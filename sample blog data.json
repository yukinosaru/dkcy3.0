That somewhat weighty combination led me to a single thought that I can\u2019t shake \u2013 **what if, in fact, it is our intelligence that is artificial?**\n\n![](http:\/\/www.thewrap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/westworld-credits-who-is-a-secret-robot-host.jpg)\n\n For decades, those in the know have talked about the singularity \u2013 a hypothesis that artificial super-intelligence will lead to a runaway transformation in life as we know it through self-perpetuating and accelerating technological advances. John van Neuman first articulated it \u2013 \u201cThe accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, can not continue\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s come to be used as a term meaning that AI reaches human levels of intelligence \u2013 that we are surpassed by the robots.\n\n![](https:\/\/hbr.org\/resources\/images\/article_assets\/2014\/12\/dec14_15_159737162.jpg)\n\n But what if we\u2019re wrong \u2013 what if our insecurities about our supremacy on this planet are unfounded? What if, instead of AI surpassing us, the advances in our understanding of intelligence and cognition lead to the revelation that what we think of as human intelligence and free will, are in fact the emergent property of a complex set of algorithms? That there is no artificial super-intelligence to fear, but that we are actually flawed and imperfect biological AI. What if the singularity is not that robots\/androids are smarter than us, but that we are dumber than we thought.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely implausible \u2013 after all psychologists have identified underlying heuristics and \u2018rules\u2019 that shape and govern our decision making. They may not be as simple as if X then do Y, and they may not occur in isolation \u2013 but there are things that guide us.\n\nHuman affairs, as we know them, will certainly change \u2013 what would be the implications? How would we handle such an almighty ego smash? What would that mean for the arc of history? Are we just pieces in a machine, with no real free will? Would personal responsibility cease to exist?"},{"header":{"title":"Macchiato","slug":"macchiato","date":"20-01-2017","published":true,"publish_date":"20-01-2017","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":0},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Food glorious food"],"tag":["coffee","food hack","coffee","food hack"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"  One of the most unexpected things about living in Addis Ababa was the coffee culture, specifically the prevalence of macchiatos (macchiati?).

The others either had splitboards or were on touring skis. As I slowly dropped back, puffing and wheezing, I realised the value of a splitboard. Every step was an energy-sapping chore, but I kept plodding on slowly, stopping occasionally to enjoy the view and catch my breath.\n\n![](http:\/\/www.dkcy.com\/images\/banner.png)\n\n ## Payoff!\n\n- - - - - -\n\nAfter about 90 minutes of climbing, we reached the top of the Arare teleski, which would have normally taken just a few minutes.

I literally felt nothing. I wasn't sure whether I'd woken up properly. Being in an airless hotel room in Abuja exacerbated the sense of disconnect and unrealness (is that even a word?).\n\nMy first real emotion was fear \u2013 fear for my family, our economic security. As a UK citizen living in France, what will this mean? We were planning to sell our flat in London and buy in France, but that dream is now on hold. My savings are now slashed, what little pension I had is now diving in value.  \n Then guilt \u2013 it's with a healthy sense of self-awareness that I note how privileged I am to have these worries. What about those who aren't so lucky?\n\n ## Anger, Disgust, Fear\n\n- - - - - -\n\nThen anger came, how could these idiots ruin our country. How could Cameron commit such a stupid act of electoral terrorism. The mental finger jabbing begins.\n\nThen belligerence and arrogant defiance, we must fight \u2013 how can we overturn this? What elite tricks can we deploy? They're fools, we can't commit economic suicide like this.\n\nThen disgust \u2013 at Farage's gloating face, at his disgusting comments about 'not a shot being fired' \u2013 what about the two to Jo Cox's chest and one to her face? Nigel, what about those? Where's your fucking humanity.\n\nThen deeper fears \u2013 unacknowledged fears. I'm a second generation immigrant. I am not white. In my youth, I have experienced violent racism \u2013 I have had to run from violent threats, I have had to stand up to ignorant hatred. These were pushed away, after all, despite its complexity, my identity is still overwhelmingly British. I don't feel threatened. Yet. No, must be more hopeful than that. We must fight hatred. That word again, 'fight'.\n\nThen more scheming. What will happen in the politics. Will Cameron go? Do we want him to go? Actually, I think we need stability and we need moderates to handle the complex negotiations that will flow from here.\n\n![](http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/560\/cpsprodpb\/F2A6\/production\/_90081126_eu_referendum_maps_app_images_624_results_no_title.png)\n\n - - - - - -\n\nSlowly acceptance creeps in. We are here. Where do we go now and how do we go there? Yes, fight, we must fight. But reading the angry voices on my various social media feeds, fear came back \u2013 we can't fight, we shouldn't fight, that just feeds the fire. Darkness cannot drive out darkness. The country has spoken and it has spoken in a fractured and divided voice. It was close \u2013 but who won doesn\u2019t really matter, Brexit or Remain, we would still have the same problem. Just looking at the map of results showed a stark picture of a divided nation. The turnout was massive \u2013 72% \u2013 there are genuine reasons and passions behind this outcome. The anger and hatred being poured forth by my allies is as worrying and disturbing as anything else.\n\nSo rationality starts to come back \u2013 we must be constructive, we must not give in to forces of hatred and division, we must not hate the Others (now the Brexiters). We must take up the exact same route that I advocated just last night.\n\nAt a practical level, there is work to be done \u2013 the civil service will now be tied in knots for years while they valiantly try to ease our passage. If nothing else, I'm a civil servant!\n\nAt a societal level, these is work to be done \u2013 we have to find a way, together, to heal the differences \u2013 and that starts with understanding, not anger.\n\nOn an immediate level, there is work to be done \u2013 I am currently in the middle of a project and need to get my head down to deliver on a complex issue in a tight timeframe, I don't have time to think about this.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nSo that's where I am. I clearly need to do some hardcore internal processing to work through this and find the calm centre within that guides my actions without. I'm clear on where we as a nation need to get to, but I need to start with myself \u2013 I need to find it in me to put aside anger, fear and hatred and find courage, patience, openness and understanding to try to make sense of this and find my place. And I need to keep bringing home the bread whilst I do this."},{"header":{"title":"Electoral terrorism","slug":"electoral-terrorism","date":"23-06-2016","published":true,"publish_date":"23-06-2016","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/1024\/cpsprodpb\/32E7\/production\/_89713031_gettyflags.jpg)\n\n  I've hesitated writing something until now \u2013 partly because I don't want to join the raucous shouting and opining, partly because I wasn't sure what I wanted to say, partly because I am still deeply traumatised by the fact that we've allowed the tragic murder of a fine young woman because of what she believed in. But on the day of this momentous referendum, I felt I needed to get some things out of my head \u2013 so this is coming at you like brain vomit.  \n## A selfish political act\n\n- - - - - -\n\n This referendum is the single most selfish political act that I've seen. It's the product of a dripping arrogance and a sense of mastery over the common people. It is the result of a stupid in-Party spat spilling over and off-loading a major, strategic and technical decision to the Great British public, who are not qualified to make such a huge decision. It is a shining example of how narrow self-interest has driven a destructive force that divides people, stokes violence and creates fear. And it is nothing short of an irresponsible act of terrorism in this country.  \n  \n The issue at hand is not really the European Union, it's about a divided society that has been failed by a set of elites that are increasingly disconnected from that society. Frustration and anger at jobs and prospects, driven by an economic downturn and exacerbated by punitive 'austerity', has been bubbling under for the last few years and the referendum is a vent that allows the disenfranchised to project that emotion \u2013 largely onto the Others (not White Walkers in this case, but Johnny Foreigner\u2026).  \n## Fiddling while Rome burns\n\n- - - - - -\n\n Instead of recognising and responding to this tension \u2013 our noble politicians have decided to play a bit of a game with the public to distract them. Just like they did in the elections where we were considered pawns in their game spurred on by the Lynton Crosbys and David Axelrods of this world \u2013 who can tell you how to get the numbers you need, but not how to truly win an election. Rather than take responsibility for improving people's lives, David Cameron wants to bait and switch \u2013 and at the same time kill the beast that has been on the back of the Tory party since Thatcher and end the Euroscepticism that has dogged party policy. So, he throws a bone to his opponents \u2013 let's have a referendum, let the people decide. It's OK he reasons, I've got this under control, I know how the people will vote, we know the campaign tactics that will get us the win \u2013 after all we wiped the floor in the General Election and we won the Scottish referendum. So he rolls the dice and launches his oh-so-clever political strategy.  \n## The genie is out of the bottle\n\n- - - - - -\n\n The trouble is that no one can control the forces that he has unleashed. Unwittingly, he has tapped the hellmouth and created a platform for all the demons to spill out onto. I agree with and sympathise with the forces that drive those that support Leave \u2013 economic growth is not being felt by the people. Ask yourself if you feel that your life has become more secure, if you are rewarded for working hard \u2013 and then imagine how it is for those less fortunate than yourselves, less educated, less connected, more pressured and stressed. With that backdrop, it's easy to seek external forces to blame \u2013 and to believe the lie that it is somehow the EU's fault, after all they found the money for Greece, why can't they help us? [insert long technical, but largely irrelevant explanation!]. It's easy to respond to the narrative being offered up. So I agree with their drivers (the people, not the Brexit ringleaders\u2026) \u2013 but I fundamentally disagree with their solution that leaving the EU is the answer, that retreating into splendid isolation will make everything better, that it's someone else's fault. But I can see where it comes from \u2013 I mean, what else is there to do? Surely change is better than the status quo? At least it'll shake things up. Unfortunately, desperation can make people do things that are not in their interest. Logic and rationality do not come into this \u2013 without a credible and compelling alternative future for our economy and society, we will never win the argument for Remaining in the EU.\n\nSo political opportunists from everywhere crawl out of the woodwork and cast clever narratives that have tested well and proven effective at mass manipulation so that they can'win'. Stoked by a well-intentioned media that drives unintended consequences \u2013 yet another another misguided elite (that's for another rant!). The politically engaged amongst us try to do what we can to sway people's views and proliferate political narratives (I can't help but feel like when we do so, we are perpetuating the status quo of politics, hence my being frozen into inaction). Yet all this succeeds in doing is taking our eye off the ball and distracting us from the fact that this is a problem of this government's creation and Parliament's collective responsibility to resolve. Instead, this grand political game is being played out on a stage that most of the country couldn't give a shit about. I'd like to call it an echo chamber, but it's the other way round \u2013 it's the British people that are stuck in a glass cell, while a bunch of egos are outside shouting at each other about who and what is right for those inside, while inside, the people are slowly suffocating. They don't care who provides it, they just want some fucking air.\n\n## Missing the point\n\n- - - - - -\n\n This referendum has successfully taken our eye off the ball and distracted us from the core issues that are dividing our society \u2013 jobs, having a roof above your head and feeling like you have a part in a fair society \u2013 none of which are left\/right issues (if that antiquated view of politics is even relevant anymore!), all of them are universal concerns. It has successfully allowed dangerous and extremist views to take hold \u2013 it has legitimised lying and manipulation and damage trust across the board \u2013 it has caused untold further damage to our society, in short, it is an act of terrorism. And even if we make it through this nightmare and vote to Remain (which I still have faith in the British public to do\u2026), the battle will not be over. The conflict will still exist and the wounds will have only been worsened.\n\n## We need a compelling alternative\n\n- - - - - -\n\n No. We don't need a poisonous debate about the EU. But we can't change where we are. Let us live through it and instead look to the future. What we need is a compelling alternative vision for the country \u2013 not a set of technocratic and incremental policies, but a bold vision and a preferred future of who we are. I know what I'd like it to be, but I don't know what it should be for the country. I don't know how we start on a journey together towards working that out. But I do know that our current systems, processes, platforms, language are not helping us on that journey. We need to have representatives that speak to the issues that matter for people, not just play the Whitehall games that will further themselves. We need to find a modern and mature way of brokering collective agreement on contentious issues rather than sweeping them away until they become toxic and divisive \u2013 maybe that's Corbyn's \"kinder, gentler politics\", maybe it's rebuilding trust in our politicians, but perhaps it\u2019s through something else, a true people-led movement for change. My hope is that in the aftermath of this referendum, we as individuals and our politicians step back and reflect on what that could be. I truly believe that we have more in common than we think we do. We just need to find a way to hear each other and work out what that is."},{"header":{"title":"Picking meskel","slug":"picking-meskel","date":"14-10-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"14-10-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](images\/meskel.jpg)\n\n I straighten my tie, put on my suit jacket, kiss my wife goodbye and step out the door. We live in a small compound, with our landlady, it's a few steps to the main gate, past a small patch of garden, where I check on this season's vegetables \u2013 sweetcorn, broadbeans, peas, aubergine, spring onion and cherry tomatoes, all surprisingly hard to find in the shops here.\n\nOut of the gate, I turn right a walk up the rocky, unpaved road, greeting a few of our neighbours along the way. The Finnish-French man opposite, married to an Ethiopian; the serious looking priest; our smiley next-door neighbour; the house of Chinese telecoms workers. Our house is at the end of a closed road \u2013 so we have a second set of gates with guards at the other end of the road, which means we don't need guards in our own compound, something we are incredibly appreciative of. They are mainly Muslim, and I greet them with a \"selam\" and they wave back.\n\nMy walk to work is about 15 minutes, but it's one of the most important parts of my daily life here. I work on abstract concepts of growth, development and transformation, but it is these few precious minutes that serve to ground me in day-to-day life in Addis, its tensions, contradictions and joys. It is my Ethiopian version of stopping to pick daisies.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nStepping over a precarious concrete drain cover, I leave the brief section of well-tarmaced road and wave to the young man in his small shop that I normally buy my phone credits from. I could follow the sealed road round, but I like to take shortcut to the right, over the bumpy, rocky terrain \u2013 it plays havoc on my thin-soled leather shoes, but takes me past the area where teenagers wash taxis and cars before rejoining the main road. It's usually here that I receive the first shout of \"China!\", something I've grown used to, having initially been irritated and offended by it. I banter a bit in Amharic and continue on.  \n The main road is known as Chechenya, named after the former war-zone \u2013 it is essentially the red-light district, lined with bars and after a certain point in the evening, heavily-made up, scantily-clad, strongly-perfumed prostitutes. This end, near the Atlas hotel, is a little more salubrious, with several nice restaurants, coffee shops and clothes stores.\n\nI pass the laundrette where my wife takes my shirts \u2013 she handwashes most of my clothes (we don't have a washing machine) but carefully delivers my shirts to the friendly ladies at Clean Solutions for cleaning and pressing \u2013 it's a small luxury that I really appreciate. A crowd of young boys calls out out to me \u2013 listros, shoe-shiners, kitted out with a wooden box to hold polish and a cut-off yellow plastic container, filled with drain water. They are my favourite characters in Chechenya (although they can be found all over the city) \u2013 the represent an industriousness and determination that is hard to fault. And they do give an amazing shine!! I often wonder what my young nephews and friends' children would think of them, the prospect of eking out an existence at such an early age. I know next to nothing about their lives, and always wonder \u2013 where do they live? What do they think of their future? Where are their parents? I like to imagine a 'career ladder' that starts with listro, grows into runner boy, minibus steward, minibus driver and reaches the ultimate pinnacle of taxi driver. It's these daily interactions with the informal sector that remind me of how critical it is to society and life here \u2013 but also how people and society self-organise and create beauty from chaos. I promise myself that one day, when my Amharic is good enough, I will sit down with a bunch of them, maybe over some tibs, and find out about their lives.\n\nThe listros normally hang out near an office furniture store, where an old security guard smiles as a young woman washes out the entranceway with a bucket. I cross over a hazardous side road with a large hole that cars have to carefully creep over. Next up is Moyo's cafe \u2013 a weekend favourite to hang out and drink coffee. It's bright green exterior and modern, Scandinavian furniture mark it out. Even early in the morning, there's usually a mix of studious people cowering behind laptops (it's one of the few places with free wifi) and Ethiopians sharing a morning coffee. Behind Moyo's is Bait Al Mandi, owned by the same people, it serves the most amazing Yemeni kubhz (bread) and is one of our hidden gems. Sometime after Bait Al Mandi, I usually cross over the road as the pavement runs out. Not that it's any better on the other side, but I feel less likely to get run over or fall in a hole.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nJust past a shiny new building where new cafes and shops are springing up, there are 3 large green skips and a team of rubbish workers, loading and sorting the fetid, stinking mass. I hold my breath as I pass, often gagging at the stench. Each of Addis Ababa's residents produce around half a kilo or solid waste a day. It is collected by teams of bin men, wheeling rusty carts from house to house. They are employed by a micro-enterprise, as primary refuse collectors \u2013 each zone of the city has one MSE. The rubbish from the Bole-Shalla area ends up here before being collected by the municipality and dumped at a site in South-West Addis known as Reppi.\n\nFor some reason, the road gets dusty at this point (and particularly at this time of the year, October, just at the start of the dry season). Early in the morning, there are often teams of older women in straw hats with a rag wrapped around their heads, sweeping the streets and collecting rubbish. They remind me of creatures from some post-apocalyptic future, clad in overalls, masked entirely in dusty, dirty rags except from their eyes, shuffling down the road.  \n Along from the skips is a school, that doesn't resemble anything that I'd think of as a school \u2013 it looks more like an apartment block from a housing estate. A thin, long building with 5 floors. I only know it's a school because of the stream of uniformed children rushing in. I'm a little late today, and two young teachers are standing at the gate, wearing lab coats and wielding sticks \u2013 they look like they should be at school themselves and I shudder for the late comers.  \n Another group of listros \u2013 this lot are older, and hang out with the taxi drivers, in some sort of symbiotic relationship, like cleaner fish to sharks. I greet them and politely decline their invitations to polish my shoes.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nA modern commercial building with an ice-cream parlour and a pizza joint marks the start of a long chain of dingy units, shuttered up at this time of day, but transformed into noisy, lively bars and the workplace for the prostitutes. This is the heart of Chechenya. If I leave early enough in the morning, I will often still see and hear the remnants from the night before \u2013 boozed up men, lying in the gutters, music still pumping from the odd venue. They are almost all sponsored by St George's, one of the oldest local beers here \u2013 their signs are uniformly bright yellow with red Amharic script. One thing that always strikes me is the pavement of St George's bottle tops crushed into the dry earth, peppering the dusty grey-brown sidewalk with flecks of yellow \u2013 remnants of hedonism. It's the sort of thing that I imagine will deeply puzzle archeologists of future civilisations. \"Who was this St George and why was he so important to these people?\".\n\nI usually have to walk with bit more purpose along here as young women try to attract my attention \u2013 they're usually in loose fitting clothing, as close to pajamas as you get here, and makeup-free. I'm polite and they are friendly, but I try not to think about their lives. A few red-eyed, dishevelled men are usually slumped in the corners watching me walk by. Very occasionally, one will start to hassle me, and if I'm not successful in fending him off, a taxi driver will come to my rescue. I find this reassuring, that somehow I'm a part of the neighbourhood and the community will look out for me. However, I'm not keen to test this beyond the odd vagrant!\n\n - - - - - -\n\nFrom here I start to reach home turf \u2013 the area around my office, where I am a lot more familiar with the various characters. Another taxi stand, in the evening, there are often women with boiling pots of sweetcorn on offer, but at this time of day, it's just more young men, looking for business. I greet those that I know and ask about their families. As I get closer to the office, a final set of listros greet me \u2013 there's one boy, a little older than the rest, maybe 12 or 13, he is always polite and incredibly hard working. I see him scurrying around doing errands for the local businesses in-between shining shoes. He's my favourite and as I'm close to the office, I agree for him to clean my shoes. He magics up a stool, wipes it down with a cloth and I sit. He's immediately a frenzy of activity: the wooden box goes down and my foot is firmly placed on it, he whips out a cloth, dips it in the yellow plastic container and swiftly wipes my shoes. In the rainy season, he uses a small wooden scraper to carefully remove mud from the stitching of my shoes. Next up is a healthy dose of polish on an old horsehair brush, his movements are precise, swift and efficient, a well-practiced trade. Dipping the brush into the water, he brings my shoe to a dull shine before buffing hard with another clean brush \u2013 which for some reason has a rattle and sounds like a can of spray paint as he industriously polishes my shoe to a mirror finish. A sharp tap of the brush indicates that I should swap feet and he starts again. I marvel at his handiwork, hand over 10 birr and wander on my way.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nAt Yeha restaurant, where I sometime go for shekla tibs (fried pieces of beef, served in a clay burner with a few hot pieces of coal) and beers after work, I greet the staff, punters and taxi drivers that are sheltering from the already hot sun. There's a sega bet (butcher) attached to it, where you can choose your beef before it's cooked. Sometimes I buy beef here on the way home to make stew or curry \u2013 around 80 birr for a half kilo.\n\nOne final taxi stand, these are the guys I use quite often, so I spend a while greeting them and asking about their families. It's a enjoyable ritual in Ethiopian culture \u2013 you can have a 10 minute conversation consisting solely of greetings \u2013 how are you? How's your wife? And your kids? Work going ok? How was your night? Everything ok? At first, I found it awkward and frustrating, but I have come to relish and cherish the human interaction \u2013 it's no less ritualised than the western \"how are you?\" but lasts longer and somehow feels more genuine. It serves as a daily reinforcing of social bonds and is usually started and ended with a firm handshake and shoulder bump \u2013 the \"fighters' salute\" a remnant of the Derg era, when anti-Derg fighters would do greet each other this way. For women, it's three kisses \u2013 something that took me a while to get used to \u2013 I'd stop at two.\n\nAfter the taxi stand, I enter a construction site, where teams of Ethiopian labourers and Israeli foreman are building a concrete flyover which will carry the road over the new light rail system that is being installed. For months, this area has been a mess, but it is rapidly taking shape. In less than a year, the road has been transformed into the bare bones of a modern transport exchange. It's been a fascinating process to watch and a privilege to witness.  \n I pass one final character, a young boy with weighing scales and an inexplicable musical device that plays an annoying tune over and over. These boys are everywhere too, and they all have the same tune, I often wonder who decided that this strange electronic melody would be the soundtrack to getting weighed. I have never seen anyone actually use these scales.\n\n - - - - - -\n\nI turn left into the Ministry grounds, greeting the guards and stepping carefully down the muddy path into the main car park. I always feel a great sense of privilege as I step into the shadow of the brutal communist building \u2013 its dull, imposing exterior unrelenting to design. Privilege at being in Ethiopia at such an exciting time in its history; at being welcomed into the Ministry; at having an office here and feeling a part of the civil service. It's incredibly frustrating and alienating a lot of the time, but stepping back and seeing the whole makes me really value it.\n\nThe walk to my office from the front gate takes me 10-15 minutes \u2013 it's only short, but I stop and greet the people I see along the way \u2013 mostly the cleaners, runners and secretaries but a few civil servants and directors. Eventually, I climb the staircase, say hi to the coffee lady, unlock my door and set up for the day."},{"header":{"title":"How true is &#8220;Yes, Minister&#8221;?","slug":"how-true-is-yes-minister","date":"08-07-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"08-07-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](http:\/\/www.yes-minister.com\/images\/oth_ypmstill3.jpg)\n\n  Alan Budd recently blogged an elaboration of a comment he made on Martin Donnelly\u2019s speech on the civil service.

How about an approach where successful businesses are rewarded. You could take a payment by results approach, but define results as profitability or rate of return rather than households served? Or alternatively, a competition where the most successful business model wins capital funding. It\u2019s still subsidising, but focussing on accelerating businesses that have demonstrated success rather than fitting a predefined (internationally imported) definition of what model or technology should be used.\n\nImagine that."},{"header":{"title":"From thinking to practice","slug":"from-thinking-to-practice","date":"16-06-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"16-06-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":["complexity","delivery","nexus","sustainability","complexity","delivery","nexus","sustainability"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](https:\/\/www.water-energy-food.org\/typo3temp\/_processed_\/csm_logo_ocp-policy-centre_21bf2fb8a0.jpg)\n\n  I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve just returned from two days at a conference on [\u00e2&#128;&#156;The Water-Food-Energy Nexus in Global Drylands\u00e2&#128;&#157;](http:\/\/www.ocppc.ma\/events\/conferences\/water-food-energy-Nexus?utm_content=buffer80344&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#.U5VXtsv6iAg), organised by the [OCP Policy Center](http:\/\/www.ocppc.ma), [Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB)](http:\/\/www.cidob.org), Texas A&M\u00c2\u00a0and [King\u00e2&#128;&#153;s College London](http:\/\/www.kcl.ac.uk). [OCP (Office Ch\u00c3\u00a9rifien des Phosphates)](http:\/\/www.ocpgroup.ma \"OCP's website\") is Morocco\u00e2&#128;&#153;s national phosphate company and the world\u00e2&#128;&#153;s biggest exporter of phosphates and derivatives. [OCP Policy Center](http:\/\/www.ocppc.ma \"OCP Policy Center\") is a new think-tank, funded by the OCP Foundation, and I have to say, so far, seems to be doing a good job of identifying key issues in the region. The subtitle of the conference was \u00e2&#128;&#156;Bridging science and policy\u00e2&#128;&#157;, based on the logic that there has been lots of \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; thinking and analysis, but little implementation. So I focussed my session on the practical implementation of all this clever \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; thinking.\n\n## There\u2019s nothing intrinsically new or novel about \u2018The Nexus\u2019\n\n- - - - - -\n\n \u00e2&#128;&#152;The Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; is neither new nor unique. Of course water, energy and food policy are linked, but then so is health, education and housing policy. Or trade, tax and economic growth. I challenged the participants to define what they mean by \u00e2&#128;&#152;implementing the nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; and to do so honestly. More often than not, and given the water-heavy audience, people actually mean \u00e2&#128;&#152;implementing IWRM\u00e2&#128;&#153; rather than anything more sophisticated. Instead, I pitched the connections between water, food and energy policy as a set of \u00e2&#128;&#152;wicked problems\u00e2&#128;&#153;. [Rittel and Webber (1973)](http:\/\/www.uctc.net\/mwebber\/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf \"Link to Rittel and Webber paper\") articulated several characteristics of \u00e2&#128;&#152;wicked problems\u00e2&#128;&#153;, but I wanted to focus on three:\n\n1. \u00e2&#128;&#156;The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems\u2026 policy problems cannot be definitively described.\u00e2&#128;&#157;\n2. \u00e2&#128;&#156;Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false;\u00e2&#128;&#157;\n3. \u00e2&#128;&#156;and it makes no sense to talk about \u2018optimal solutions\u2019 to these problems\u2026Even worse, there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers.\u00e2&#128;&#157;\n\nThe challenge is how government, private sector and civil movements interact (the \u00e2&#128;&#152;system\u00e2&#128;&#153;) to make \u00e2&#128;&#152;good enough\u00e2&#128;&#153; in the face of hard choices and on behalf of \u00e2&#128;&#152;us\u00e2&#128;&#153;.\n\n## Framing matters\n\n- - - - - -\n\nMy second main point was that framing and context matter. How you talk about and define \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus issues\u00e2&#128;&#153; has an impact on what your solutions might be. \u00e2&#128;&#152;The Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; is not an objective concept \u00e2&#128;&#147; it is a slippery socio-political construct masquerading as apolitical science. \u00e2&#128;&#152;Implementing the Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; is too often focussed on protecting natural resources for their own sake, which has limited political traction. I offered three alternate frames in current use that seem to have more traction:\n\n- **As enablers of economic development** \u2013\u00c2\u00a0Water in and of itself is not an economic driver, but key growth sectors require reliable water supplies \u00e2&#128;&#147; it is a necessary but insufficient condition for growth. In turn, growth can provide the necessary resources for poverty eradication. Energy is similar, but can be a direct source of growth \u00e2&#128;&#147; for example, if it is exported in the form of petroleum products or electricity. Food is essential for growth by maintaining a healthy workforce but also commercial agriculture in some countries. This framing concentrates on the development or exploitation of water, energy and food resources.\n- **As amplifiers of strategic resource stress** \u2013\u00c2\u00a0The flipside of being prerequisites for growth is that mismanagement of these resources can amplify resource scarcity \u00e2&#128;&#147; which at best acts as a drag on growth but in extremes can contribute to political instability if scarcity critically undermines the legitimacy of governments. Water is a resource challenge in itself, but it also serves to amplify other resource challenges by acting as a critical input and enabler in the extraction and use of food or energy. For example, irrigation can be a stressor of water availability in some context, but a solution to food security in others; water is also vital for security of thermal energy production. This framing is about avoiding and managing scarcity.\n- **As an international relations challenge** \u2013\u00c2\u00a0Energy and food are global, transnational challenges where the global food and energy systems require common global responses to maintain stability. Water is still a transnational challenge \u00e2&#128;&#147; but it differs from other global challenges in subtle ways. Water is a global challenge where the solutions are at national and sub-national level. However, at the same time, national policies (or their absence) can lead to implications beyond national borders, so multilateral action on water is needed to facilitate and co-ordinate responses rather than homogenise or consolidate them. This framing is about the political implications of water, energy and food use.\n\n\nEach of these framings is complex, but also interlinked, exponentially increasing the complexity of the situation. However, currently, these links in and between water, food and energy is not adequately reflected in decision-making. Water, food and energy policy are made in isolation, without fully considering the implications for the other policy areas. The \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; points to the obvious interconnectedness, but not what to do about it\u00e2&#128;&#147; it needs grounding in the realities of developing and delivering effective public policy in messy and complex political economy contexts.\n\n## Practical suggestions\n\n- - - - - -\n\nFinally I ended with some reflections on a practical approach, based on the strong assumptions that **governance** is the key issue; the state is the main actor; and capability is the limiting factor. To that end, I suggested\u00c2\u00a0that interventions focus\u00c2\u00a0on how decisions are made and implemented rather than just the \u00e2&#128;&#152;what\u00e2&#128;&#153; \u2013 in three focal areas (three is the magic number\u00e2&#128;\u00a6)\n\n- **Improve \u00e2&#128;&#152;good enough\u00e2&#128;&#153; decision-making** \u00e2&#128;&#147; expose complexity whilst simplifying decisions. Develop analytical tools that seek to answer a relevant policy problem. Bassel Daher from the [Qatar Foundation](http:\/\/www.qf.org.qa) gave a good example used in Qatar.\n- **Address systemic bottlenecks to delivery** \u00e2&#128;&#147; Institutional structures, static delivery models and financing vehicles need to be analysed more thoroughly. What\u00e2&#128;&#153;s really holding back progress? What are the root causes? This in turn should lead to targeted interventions rather than generic \u00e2&#128;&#152;capacity building\u00e2&#128;&#153; efforts.\n- **Living delivery system** \u2013 develop adaptable policies and learning mechanisms. Given that it is impossible to make perfect up-front decisions, delivery systems need to provide feedback and have the flexibility to tweak and improve decisions whilst they are being implemented. Matt Andrews and Lant Pritchett propose [\u00e2&#128;&#152;Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation\u00e2&#128;&#153;](http:\/\/www.hks.harvard.edu\/centers\/cid\/programs\/building_state_capability\/what-is-pdia) \u00e2&#128;&#147; clunky, techno-babble title aside, it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s a great framing and practical concept.\n \n\n## Great conversation, but so what?\n\n- - - - - -\n\nOverall, it was an interesting and diverse conversation, with a suite of presentations from across disciplines. My only major criticism was the lack of female presenters \u00e2&#128;&#147; just 2 out of 32 (6%) of speakers and facilitators were women. The organisers blamed the lack of applications, but I think a lot more could and should have been done to get a more diverse set of voices. I don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t believe in arbitrary or token women, but there are some excellent, capable and eloquent women who could have contributed other perspectives.\n\nOther than this, I particularly enjoyed throwing some bricks and challenging the \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; group-think. However, what struck me was the inability to think outside of the \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; frame and language. If \u00e2&#128;&#152;Nexus\u00e2&#128;&#153; proponents really want to bridge science and policy, then they need to understand their target audience. Policy makers are not passive recipients of your wisdom. They are active agents in a political system. Policy makers have multiple competing issues in front of them \u00e2&#128;&#147; and they have larger priorities. If you cannot translate your issue into their language, into things that really matter to them, then you will not impact their decision \u2013 and maybe, just maybe, your current choice of framing is not relevant to those in power.\n\nHere\u2019s the lowdown on Storify\n\n  \n[[View the story \u201cWater-Food-Energy in Global Drylands\u201d on Storify](\/\/storify.com\/YukiNoSaru\/water-food-energy-in-global-drylands)]"},{"header":{"title":"New year, new look","slug":"new-year-new-look","date":"22-01-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"22-01-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/mpr\/mpr\/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAasAAAAJDcwMTUwMDAwLTQ3YTMtNDUwNi04NzU5LTVlNGM0NTlhYWFhNQ.jpg)\n\n  In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I decided that it was time to refresh the look of the site.

It sparked me to posting about something that\u2019s been in the back of my mind for a while \u2013 public policy delivery, specifically in developing countries.\u00c2\u00a0The development world is largely focussed on developing and delivery public policy \u2013 so, education, health, security, energy, etc. Yet development professionals by and large have a \u2018development\u2019 background \u2013 it\u2019s relatively rare to find development agency staff with real world public policy experience. People who have worked on education policy in their country, or who have worked in the NHS, or for an energy regulator. Granted, there are contextual issues in a developing country, like low salaries, staff retention issues \u2013 but these are issues we face around the world (albeit at different scales). Surely a career in developing and delivering health policy in South Korea is of more value than a Masters degree in Development Studies? So my answer to the question \u201cWhy expats?\u201d is less about their expat-ness and more about what people have to bring \u2013 if they have expertise and skills that can help in delivering public policy, then there is a clear rationale for them \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter where they are from, domestic, regional or international; developed or developing country \u2013 as long as they have something professionally relevant to bring.\n\nI would love to see more peer-to-peer exchange, where public policy professionals and civil servants from around the world work in different countries to share insights \u2013 this is particularly true at the management level. It\u2019s an approach that the [Africa Governance Initative (AGI)](http:\/\/www.africagovernance.org\/ \"Africa Governance Initiative\") use, where they tend to focus on placing senior civil servants in developing country ministries to help build delivery capability.\u00c2\u00a0But why not go further and have exchanges the other way? What better way to inspire and motivate a civil servant than to show them how it could work in their country? To build a generation of young leaders who can have an impact on public policy delivery, drawing on what does and doesn\u2019t work in other countries \u2013 adapted to their national and cultural context. How could we convince say, the UK Treasury, to employ someone from the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance and Economic Development to work on UK macroeconomic growth policy?\n\nI think it would also help break down the paternalistic and patronising development dynamic by emphasising what\u2019s common across countries and not their developing\/developedness. Regardless of context, the same skillsets are needed for public policy \u2013 an ability to synthesise analysis from different disciplines, systems thinking, public engagement, financing, delivery mechanisms, value-for-money.\n\nFinally, I think this would also go a long way to challenging negative perceptions of \u2018faceless bureaucrats\u2019 \u2013 the public tend to have a very negative view of civil servants. My theory is that it\u2019s because no-one really understands what they do (plus there is genuinely a lot of waste and deadwood in the public sector in any country\u2026).\n\nI\u2019m sure there are initiatives out there that try to do this \u2013 so do let me know of any!"},{"header":{"title":"Enkuan adderesachu","slug":"enkuan-adderesachu","date":"07-01-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"07-01-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["\u12a0\u12f2\u1235\u1240\u1295 (Addis\/New Days)"],"tag":["delivery","delivery"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![](http:\/\/www.ethiopia-explore.com\/images\/stock\/genna2.JPG)\n\n *Melkam Genna*! Happy Ethiopian Christmas (*Genna*).\u00c2\u00a0Ethiopian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 7th January (Tahesas 28\/29 by the Ethiopian calendar) \u2013 typically by slaughtering an animal and feasting with family and friends. We were privileged this year to be invited to two Genna feasts \u2013 one at a friend\u2019s and another at a local guesthouse where other friends were staying. I learnt that we greet each other at this time of year by saying *\u2018Enkuan adderesachu\u2019*, which roughly translates as \u2018give thanks for bringing us here \u2018 and to which the response is *\u2018enkuan abro adderesachen\u2019* \u2013 \u2018give thanks for us arriving together\u2019. At work, I\u2019ve been wrestling with the challenge of delivery. Both my own \u2018delivery\u2019 \u2013 i.e. what am I actually doing or producing? \u2013 but also delivery of public policy here in Ethiopia \u2013 i.e. how do plans and political objectives become realities? [GGGI](http:\/\/www.gggi.org \"GGGI Website\")\u00c2\u00a0is working in Ethiopia to support the Government to deliver a *\u2018Climate Resilient Green Economy\u2019* and to help direct international climate finance to that purpose.\u00c2\u00a0In the water and energy sectors, this is currently focussing on climate resilience \u2013 what does the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy (MoWIE) need to do to contribute to the climate resilience of Ethiopia? In abstract, this means thinking about what adaptations and new things the Ministry needs to do, but on closer inspection, the reality is that, in a country like Ethiopia, the vast majority of what MoWIE is doing already contributes to climate resilience \u2013 water and energy are defining issues for the country, its people and economy.\u00c2\u00a0The challenge is less about novelty or developing new strategies, instead it is more about delivering existing policies and political priorities \u2013 the same public policy challenge that every single country in the world faces. So why haven\u2019t existing plans been fully delivered?\n\nIt is easy to fall back on the excuse of \u2018weak capacity\u2019 or the need for \u2018capacity building\u2019. But in my time here I have seen plenty of \u2018capacity\u2019 \u2013 talented, passionate individuals who can get stuff done. I\u2019ve also seen significant financial resources made available \u2013 but critically not spent. And I\u2019ve seen well-thought out policies and programmes. So the delivery challenge is not about \u2018capacity\u2019 in its traditional sense, instead it seems to be about finding the right way of working together. I don\u2019t fully understand all the issues, but I have seen projects and ideas pushed forward that are driven by a goal-oriented management culture \u2013 that often stumble because they don\u2019t reflect the relationship-oriented culture here (I\u2019ve seen similar in Japan). Where insufficient time is spent on really understanding each others\u2019 perspectives and jointly finding solutions \u2013 unfortunately, I know the practical reality is that domestic pressures drive the bias towards a more mechanistic\/transactional approach. It is much much harder to break out of the transactional relationship, but if we\u2019re honest about partnership, then all sides have to take the time to understand each other \u2013 which takes time, patience and the ability to listen. I feel immensely privileged to be in a situation where I can take the time to do this \u2013 and I am only at the start of this conversation. To me, that feels like the biggest delivery challenge here \u2013 working out how people genuinely work in partnership to arrive together. *Enkuan adderesachu.*"},{"header":{"title":"Sharing the Search","slug":"sharing-the-search","date":"01-01-2014","published":true,"publish_date":"01-01-2014","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["\u12a0\u12f2\u1235\u1240\u1295 (Addis\/New Days)"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"My new year\u2019s resolution is \u2018Screw connectivity, post more\u2019, so hold me to it!\n\nI joined GGGI because I believe that the dominant economic models of our time are broken and that our future lies in evolving new models.

You can\u2019t comprehend it until you\u2019ve been through it.\n\nSo, in the spirit of my new year\u2019s resolution, I will attempt to share the journey, to open up the search \u2013 a thousand mile journey begins with a single step, this is mine."},{"header":{"title":"Means and ends","slug":"means-and-ends","date":"16-07-2012","published":true,"publish_date":"16-07-2012","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["For Tea Too"],"tag":["complexity","lebenskrankheit","reflection","sustainability","complexity","lebenskrankheit","reflection","sustainability"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![Moroccan mint tea being poured into a small glass](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/IMG_20110801_115600-150x200.jpg \"Moroccan Mint Tea\")As some of you may know I\u2019ve been throwing around an idea about opening a teashop for a while. To me, tea is the quintessentially social drink. Almost everywhere around the world has some sort of culture around tea. From builders tea to chai to attaya to moroccan mint tea or yerba mate. I think it crosses boundaries and lowers barriers, lubricating the social fabric.\n\nBut I want this tea shop to be more than just about tea, but to symbolise the essence of tea \u2013 what Okakura called \u2018teaism\u2019 in his seminal piece [The Book of Tea](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Book_of_Tea). Bringing people together, celebrating simplicity and providing the environment for people to become the best they can \u2013 in practical terms, providing community space, creative space, training and mentoring for local people. Recently, I\u2019ve begun to realise that this is what people are now calling a social enterprise.\n\nSo, I was delighted when I spotted[ London Creative Labs Social Startup Lab ](http:\/\/londoncreativelabs.com\/social-startup-labs) in my neighbourhood. It promised an exciting day where people from all walks of life could germinate their social enterprise ideas.\u00c2\u00a0I found it an intriguing experience and with a lot of tools and approaches that I am familiar with (Open Space, conversational learning). However, it felt strangely distanced from what I was hoping to learn and do.\n\nThe most insightful point of the day for me was tagging along with 3 lovely people I\u2019d only just met, to go and get some lunch. We chatted about Brixton and the community and all the efforts that have been made over the past decades. We talked about Brixton Village and all the things it had brought \u2013 both good and bad. Despite their positivity and creativity, there was an underlying air of having seen all this good intent before and of communities being \u2018involved\u2019, but actually feeling drained; tapped of ideas from which they have not been able to benefit. I really enjoyed their company and wished we\u2019d had more time.\n\nOne of the key challenges in my professional life as someone working in international development is the question \u201c*Who am I to \u2018help\u2019 these people?*\u201c, \u201c*What can I really bring?*\u201c. I often feel that I must be seen as patronising and naive when I rock up at some rural village in my \u2018field shoes\u2019, trying to be all local and participatory. Often I feel that life would be better for poor people if the well-meaning elites like me just got out of the way. *What do I really know about their daily existence?* And that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m beginning to think more towards my own communities and my own neighbourhood \u2013 a people and culture that I hopefully know better.\n\nSitting in the The Brix today, with flipcharts and post-its everywhere, with eloquent, well-meaning facilitators \u2013 I still felt carried in a river that wasn\u2019t of my choosing, and I realised that looking closer to home doesn\u2019t make it any easier. That it\u2019s so easy to try to do a good thing but in the process failing to acknowledge the boundaries that you need to cross \u2013 and not realise that you might be helping yourself more than nurturing others. I suddenly realised what all the communities we work with feel like. And how terribly disempowering it can be. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were lots of great things about today \u2013 not least the other people taking part, but I felt a sense of disconnect.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure what my point is here, but I\u2019ve learnt a lot today about social enterprise and about community work. There\u2019s still so much more for me to learn, but fortunately there\u2019s a wealth of history and experience to draw on."},{"header":{"title":"Water Worlds &#8211; Scarcity and Access","slug":1182,"date":"27-08-2011","published":true,"publish_date":"27-08-2011","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Water","water everywhere"],"tag":["complexity","sustainability","water","complexity","sustainability","water"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"Originally posted on [Reuters AlertNet](http:\/\/www.trust.org\/alertnet\/blogs\/the-debating-chamber\/water-worlds-scarcity-and-access\/)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nThe world is in the midst of a water crisis. The typical story is that fresh water supplies are running out and that we are bleeding the earth dry.\n\nWater, one of the fundamentals for all life, is getting scarcer so we need to value it more and manage the fresh water resources to ensure that they don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t run out. But the real story goes deeper than that.\n\nThere is solid evidence behind concerns over scarcity. The 2030 Water Resources Group suggests the world will face a 40 percent global shortfall between forecast demand and available supply by 2030, and that by then more than a third of the global population will be living in river basins coping with significant water stress.\n\nThe negative effects of this water stress can be felt across the world\u00e2&#128;&#153;s ecosystems as rivers silt up, habitats are destroyed and people struggle to farm and grow crops.\n\nLack of water has a huge impact on food security, and in extreme cases such as we\u00e2&#128;&#153;re currently seeing in the Horn of Africa, a water stressed area can be easily pushed into famine.\n\nThis growing scarcity, worsened by demand growth and climate change, means that we need to work out how to fairly share a finite resource as well as how to use water that we have more effectively.\n\nBut that is only one part of the crisis \u2013 the scarcity challenge is intertwined with a second, less-acknowledged dimension of the global water crisis \u00e2&#128;&#147; the \u00e2&#128;&#156;challenge of access\u00e2&#128;&#157;.\n\nSome 884 million people don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t have access to safe drinking water, for them this is a crisis happening right\u00c2\u00a0 now \u00e2&#128;&#147; preventable diarrhoea kills more children in sub-Saharan Africa than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.\n\nThis puts a huge disease burden on the health systems in developing countries and holds back overall economic development.\n\nIf we are to really tackle the global water crisis, we must realise that scarcity and lack of access are intimately linked. Fairly sharing a finite resource cannot happen without universal access; and universal access is threatened by physical limits to the resource and political attention being diverted by more visible issues.\n\nSolving these interlocking challenges is deeply linked to addressing other major issues, including energy, food and climate change.  \n Water worlds\n\nWater is used in a wide range of ways, so water means different things to different people \u00e2&#128;&#147; and water issues are talked about separately depending on the context. I have loosely characterised these \u00e2&#128;&#156;water worlds\u00e2&#128;&#157; below:\n\n\u00e2&#128;\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Water stewardship \u00e2&#128;&#147; Focus on management of water resources and ecosystems. Key issues include: efficiency of use; cost-recovery; management and distribution.  \n \u00e2&#128;\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Water and sanitation poverty \u00e2&#128;&#147; Focus on access to improved water sources by the most marginalised of society. Key issues include: addressing political and power dynamics of access.  \n In addition, these \u00e2&#128;&#156;worlds\u00e2&#128;&#157; interact with others  \n \u00e2&#128;\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Food Security \u00e2&#128;&#147; predominantly concerned with agricultural supply, price dynamics, and production efficiency.  \n \u00e2&#128;\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Millennium Development Goals \u00e2&#128;&#147; particularly nutrition (MDG 1, 4, 5, 6), but also maternal health (MDG 5), child mortality (MDG 4), education (MDG 2) and gender equality (MDG 3).  \n \u00e2&#128;\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Climate change \u00e2&#128;&#147; the common narrative is that climate change is all about water \u00e2&#128;&#147; too much, too little, the wrong type. This is true for surface water, but much more complicated for groundwater.\n\nPooling the waters\n\nTackling the global water crisis means that these \u00e2&#128;&#152;water worlds\u00e2&#128;&#153; need to be linked. Yet, to date the growing number of water security initiatives fails to take into account the human dimension of exclusion. For example, the 2030 Water Resources Group\u00e2&#128;&#153;s \u00e2&#128;&#152;Charting our Water Future\u00e2&#128;&#153; breaks new ground in finding practical ways of meeting growing demand, but is largely irrelevant in the context of the least developed countries, with no mention of access or the debilitating impact of WASH poverty on economies. If decision makers around the world really want to tackle the world\u00e2&#128;&#153;s water crisis, then they need to take action to address both scarcity and access.  \n Experts from around the world will meet next week in Stockholm \u2013 if they can step outside their boundaries and work together with others, it\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll go a long way to turn this crisis into a real opportunity to show how economy, environment and development can be addressed together to unlock green growth.\n\n\u00a0"},{"header":{"title":"Details details","slug":"details-details","date":"02-04-2011","published":true,"publish_date":"02-04-2011","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Itchy Feet"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"I\u2019d just shuffled forward to the red block embedded in the snow and turned the catch the approaching chair, when he scooted forward and sat next to me.

We get chatting and I promise to visit [his gallery](http:\/\/www.gallerykeoki.com) in the village at Squaw.\n\nThe next afternoon, I duly pop in after another fantastic day riding Squaw. Wow. His photos are incredible and I wander around open-mouthed at his images and how they\u2019re presented \u2013 bonded straight onto a high-quality perspex that gives them an incredible pop. \u2018High Definition for photos\u2019 is how he describes it.

What do I shoot? Well I guess it\u2019s what I see, which is often travel-related, but sometimes landscapes, sometimes abstracts, sometimes black and white, light\/form. Hmm. I have tried to define my approach before, but somehow felt that I haven\u2019t really got it straight yet. I like the element of chance, uncertainty and spontaneity and I\u2019d love to be a street photographer (particularly after watching\u00c2\u00a0a clip about the\u00c2\u00a0[rediscovery of Vivian Maier\u2019s work](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HWEDOnBfDUI&feature=player_embedded)), but I feel uncomfortable literally taking someone\u2019s picture. It feels invasive. So instead I try to be present, to pick out little details, things that speak to me about a place and time. So does that make me a sort of inanimate street photographer? Or documentary self-portrait? I dunno really and I guess it doesn\u2019t matter, but I\u2019d like to be able to answer that question in a more self-assured way next time.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, the only natural thing to do was to take my camera out and go and take some photos.

In 2006 coffee exports accounted some $350 million, equivalent to 34% of that year\u2019s total exports\u2026  \n>  Ethiopia is the world\u2019s 7th largest producer of coffee, and Africa\u2019s top producer, with 260,000 metric tonnes in 2006\n\nAnd I\u2019ve just come back from San Francisco, where you can\u2019t walk more than 10 metres without a coffee shop of some sort.

One of our local WaterAid staff took me to a supermarket and proudly showed me the shelves of ground coffee \u2013 wanting to be a bit more authentic, I asked him if I could get some beans. He was a bit confused, and after a while responded with \u201cah, yes, raw coffee\u201d and hustled me back into the car. After driving around for a while, he abruptly stopped outside a tiny shack and shouted over at the man behind a set of rusty scales. A brief haggling exchange resulted in a 500g bag of beans for about \u00c2\u00a33. Great! Except for the teeny tiny fact that they were green, unroasted beans. Too embarrassed and guilty to reject them, I sheepishly paid and smiled gratefully wondering what the hell to do with them.\n\nReturning home, a quick Google search turned up lots of home-roasting pages. Turns out there\u2019s quite an industry in it. Always game for a from-first-principles product, I gave it a crack. Dispensing with the technology (roasters, temperature gauges, roasting profiles, etc) that is apparently vital to a good roast, I whipped out my faithful wok.

Everyone from governments to NGOs to media are there, fighting climate change. Everyone who\u00e2&#128;&#153;s anyone in the world of climate change is there. But not me. \u00e2&#128;&#156;Why not?!\u00e2&#128;&#157; I hear you cry. I work on climate change, I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve been to previous COPs, I know the players, I know the politics. It is precisely because of this that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve chosen not to go.\n\n  \n Firstly, the political reality is that Cancun is about [two things](http:\/\/unfccc.int\/files\/meetings\/ad_hoc_working_groups\/lca\/application\/pdf\/pre_cop16_speech_lca_chair.pdf): mitigation (developed and developing country and MRV, or trust and transparency as normal people would say) and finance (agreeing how to set up a new global fund; and where the money will come from). In short this is about getting the main political agreements from the [Copenhagen Accord](http:\/\/unfccc.int\/resource\/docs\/2009\/cop15\/eng\/11a01.pdf) formally into the UN system.\n\nIt\u00e2&#128;&#153;s no secret that there are certain countries that do not want a deal. Often they will manipulate and at time bully others into adopting a line that blocks progress, even if it is against their own interest. The key to an international deal is to break this negative dynamic. As [Wangari Maathai sets out](http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/cif-green\/2010\/nov\/26\/cancun-climate-change-conference?CMP=twt_fd), it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s about rebuilding trust in each other and the UN system. As powerful and almighty as I am (\\*cough, cough\\*), I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m afraid I can\u00e2&#128;&#153;t really change that.\n\nDon\u00e2&#128;&#153;t get me wrong, I would love to go. It\u00e2&#128;&#153;s exciting and buzzy to be there amongst a great community of people \u00e2&#128;&#147; many of whom are my friends. It\u00e2&#128;&#153;s great for networking and building knowledge. But for actually influencing the negotiations, for all the sound and fury, there is very little that signifies anything \u2013 to borrow an in-joke, it\u2019s not a Party-driven process, it\u2019s a process-driven party. Having been part of the one of the key Party delegations, I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve seen how much the outcomes are dictated by broader politics.\n\nSo should we abandon hope? No. There is much work to be done \u2013 but at a national level. For example, the UK is passing a raft of funding decisions about mitigation, that most climate NGOs are not engaged in. And [Bangladesh, Niger and Tajikistan have just received $280m](http:\/\/go.worldbank.org\/XJ5DJ9EMP0) between them to become more climate resilient (by the way, that\u2019s real money, not just pledges \u2013 and it\u2019s already leveraged several hundred million more from development banks) and could genuinely help people cope with climate change. The best way to help the international negotiations is not to be there, but to focus on changing national politics and policies around the world, particularly in laggards (no names mentioned!). It\u00e2&#128;&#153;s about demonstrating that low carbon development doesn\u00e2&#128;&#153;t have to mean poor economic performance, in fact, low carbon development can mean riding new markets and investment now saves money \u2013 and that [some developing countries have a competitive advantage in these fields](http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2010-07-22\/rutgers-chinese-connection-signals-solar-panels-coming-to-roof-near-you.html).\n\nFinally, I chose to leave the negotiations world because even if we stopped all our emissions now, we would still be locked into a certain amount of change. This will impact on the poorest and most vulnerable (incidentally, this is one key issue to watch out for \u2013 how do you define vulnerability. G77 will tie themselves in knots over this). I believe that we will find ways to adapt, but it will not necessarily be done equitably. We have a responsibility to work with governments to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable are addressed. This happens at a national level, not in the halls of the UNFCCC. In some countries this will be highly political and will mean tackling established power relationships \u2013 *it will not be easy and will demand struggle.*\n\nThe political and financial attention given to climate change gives us a unique window of opportunity. If we can use climate change to find ways to reduce vulnerability, both concrete on-the-ground interventions and through systemic interventions around governance and power, then we will go some way to address the power inbalances and politics that are at the heart of development and equality.\n\nSo instead I will be in Burkina Faso, working with local partners and government to understand how to help local communities manage their water more equitably and sustainably so that they can cope with changes in climate. We don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t have all the answers, but we also don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t have the time to sit around and figure it all out. Therefore we need to find a balance between trying things and developing building blocks \u00e2&#128;&#147; learning-by-doing if you like. In time we will be able to build this knowledge and in turn feed it back into the negotiations.\n\nI don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t pretend that what I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m doing is any more effective than being in Cancun, but if we really want to make a difference to people\u00e2&#128;&#153;s lives, we must look inwards and question what will really drive change and where each of us fits. That\u2019s the change in climate that I want to see."},{"header":{"title":"Excuses&#8230;","slug":"excuses","date":"30-09-2010","published":true,"publish_date":"30-09-2010","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"OK, so I\u2019m still rubbish at updating my blog.

This time it\u2019s work related. After a short trip to Brussels to take part in the [Alliance for Water Stewardship](http:\/\/www.allianceforwaterstewardship.org\/) Roundtable, I\u2019ll be heading off to Nigeria for a regional team strategy meeting, supporting their advocacy work. I\u2019m part of WaterAid\u2019s West Africa regional team, one of our regions consisting of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger and Nigeria. There\u2019s plenty I could tell you about each of the countries, but here are some snippets:\n\n- The Sahel region includes part of Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria. Traditionally, most of the people in the Sahel have been semi-nomadic, grazing livestock in the North during the wet season and migrating south during the dry period. Remember that [Barclaycard advert](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G1ksngBjmWA) with Rowan Atkinson walking off with a burning carpet saying \u2018smell those Touareg campfires\u2019?\n- Niger is roughly 2\/3 desert and is currently in the grip of a major food crisis. Every year, the country faces food shortages with a \u2018hungry season\u2019 from May to July, but this year it started in February. It is the lowest ranked country in the [UN\u2019s Human Development Report 2009](http:\/\/hdrstats.undp.org\/en\/countries\/country_fact_sheets\/cty_fs_NER.html). WaterAid has just started working in Niger.\n- WaterAid has also just started working in the conflict-affected countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia, as a joint programme run from Monrovia.\n- Nigeria are playing South Korea in the World Cup while I\u2019m there :). Go Super Eagles!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.wateraid.org\/images\/cm_images\/bangladesh\/DSC02946canpaywillpay.jpg \"Bangladeshi woman receiving her first water bill\")](http:\/\/www.wateraid.org\/bangladesh\/default.asp)After that, I\u2019m heading straight from Abuja through to Bangladesh (well, as straight as the ridiculous aviation industry will allow), where I\u2019ll be for 3 weeks to work with [WaterAid Bangladesh](http:\/\/www.wateraid.org\/bangladesh\/default.asp) on climate change and disaster risk reduction, a combination of some field visits and advocacy work. Bangladesh suffers floods annually \u2013 largely due to increases on rain upstream rather than sea level rises (although storm surges from cyclones drive some floods). Flood season is June to September, during the monsoon. Other water related issues that Bangladesh face include arsenic contamination of wells, and salt-water contamination along the coast, driven by over-use of groundwater.\n\nOn the sanitation front, WaterAid\u2019s partner, Village Education Resource Centre (VERC) successfully developed the [Community Led Total Sanitation](http:\/\/www.communityledtotalsanitation.org\/) (unfortunately abbreviated as CLTS) approach, where communities work to create \u2018open defecation free\u2019 villages through changing attitudes and behaviours rather than just building toilets for individual households.\n\nSo there we go, a small taste of what I\u2019ll be doing over the next month and some of the challenges in the countries that we work.

We were invincible. Pook got a parking ticket from a jobsworth traffic cop who seemed intent on spoiling someone\u2019s new year. Gareth got horrendously drunk but still managed to wander his way back to my place. I laughed, drank, cried and hugged my way into the brilliant new millennium. We were free. Life was fun, spontaneous and crazy.\n\nIt was the year that everything started. I knew everyone, I was playing badminton every day, running training sessions several times a week, volunteering for Nightline, writing for the student paper. 4 months later I went through the most incredible experience of my life, campaigning hard and eventually finding myself elected President. I had an emotional and spiritual growth spurt.\n\nThe rest of the decade has been a whirlwind. I met an incredible woman and shared wonderful times together. I learnt to dive, to snowboard, to climb, to use a camera, to tango, to raft, to love, to grieve. I discovered politics, encountered the UN and went inter-railing through Eastern Europe, returning to start work for the MOD.\u00c2\u00a0 I unexpectedly fell in love and landed my dream job. I bought a house and had succeeded in life, before asking myself too many questions. I quit my dream job and sold my house to chase rainbows in New Zealand, not knowing that NZ would lead to Colorado and coming home to a place I\u2019d never been before.\n\nI had the worst year of my life to date. Trapped in a job I hated, crashed out of love, experienced two friends dieing unexpectedly and before their time, I was homeless and directionless. I let the darkness overtake me and slipped into depression, before clawing my way out and getting my head back above water. I let someone into my life bringing light with them and with whom I properly shared my whole life for the first time.\n\nI chased rainbows through Thailand, Coventry, Cornwall, South Africa, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore and ended up in retreat in Japan, trying to prove something to myself, but learning far more than I\u2019d planned to. I chose to come back and fell into the most intense experience of my life, chasing a global dream that ended in Copenhagen discord.\n\n[![Road ahead](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSC00214-150x200.jpg \"Road ahead\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/DSC00214.jpg)And now?

It\u2019s an ever evolving kaleidoscope of thought, but I felt it was time to try to share it more. But as I do so, I\u2019m reminded of a quote from a great sage:\n\n> \u201cWhen you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and Think of Things, you find sometimes that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it.\u201d\n\nWe are a great moment of change. A period of instability, and in a complex living system, novelty emerges from critical points of instability.\n\nHow would I characterise this instability? It\u2019s a feeling. A sense of powerlessness, a general malaise often disguised by escapism and consumerism, but we feel something is wrong and we\u2019re starting to think about it. We work jobs that often have little meaning, that are a means to an end. We are passengers, flotsam in the river of life, slowly being washed out to sea. Our world, our creation, seems out of control \u2013 we\u2019ve successfully created a complex living breathing system that is beyond our control. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s uncontrolled, it\u2019s just that it is self controlled and although we are the system, we cannot direct it. Control is an emergent phenomena ([Frijtof Capra](http:\/\/www.fritjofcapra.net\/) has written some excellent work on these concepts and set up the [Center for Ecoliteracy](http:\/\/www.ecoliteracy.org\/)).\n\nHow does this lack of control manifest itself? Global inequality, rampant consumerism, war, violence, hunger, poverty, the faltering of the economic system (I won\u2019t describe it as a collapse just yet), climate change. Giddens described it as a runaway world. To me, we are like cellular slime mould \u2013 a remarkable organism that will create beautiful complex patterns when a population is grown in a petri dish, patterns that increase in complexity and beauty as the individuals interact in ever more intertwined, networked ways. Eventually this breaks into a third dimension and the individual cells begin to behave like a whole \u2013 a 3d organism emerges (there\u2019s a whole other ramble about the role of global communications technologies and the internet in faciliting this development, but I\u2019ll save that for another time).\n\nWe as a species have multiplied and grown, interacting with each other in increasingly sophisticated ways until now, we are starting to emerge as a living single organism. That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re all going to join hands and teach the world to sing, but we are part of an interconnected whole ([DFID\u2019s White Paper](http:\/\/www.dfid.gov.uk\/About-DFID\/Quick-guide-to-DFID\/How-we-do-it\/Building-our-common-future\/) is but one acknowledgement of this).\n\nThis critical point of instability is exciting and worrying \u2013 it\u2019s a uncertain and messy, out of our individual control. And the change, the novelty that will emerge, this sort of paradim shift is on the same scale as the Reformation and the Renaissance. Its scale and nature are so great that we cannot comprehend what the other side will look like, yet we will look back and wonder how on earth we thought like we do now. And, try as we might, we cannot plan it and mobilise the masses to bring it to life (although these efforts will be part of the change, just as carrying on will be part of the change \u2013 there\u2019s so much more to be said about this, but again, it\u2019ll have to wait). This next R of the world is driven by a cast of thousands of changes and socio-political drivers, yet in a way we can\u2019t do anything about it, it is just happening. In some ways it\u2019s a Reimagining of the world, a Rethinking of our view, but they both imply conscious thought and control. So is it ceding control, a Relaxation of our cartesian desires? Or is it simply a Realisation, a Revealing (or perhaps for those with a more biblical bent, a Revelation)?"},{"header":{"title":"Reflection","slug":"reflection","date":"10-10-2009","published":true,"publish_date":"10-10-2009","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["For Tea Too"],"tag":["climate change","lebenskrankheit","reflection","climate change","lebenskrankheit","reflection"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"My plan to post meaningful insights from the Bangkok climate talks proved a bit too ambitious. 2 weeks of frantic running around, wheelspinning or as a friend put it, the cha-cha-cha \u2013 movement with the illusion of progress.  \n Impressions?

It\u2019s a painful topic, sadly omitted from Kyoto as a tragedy of the commons. Unable to agree responsibility for the emissions, the issue was shunted into ICAO and IMO, the international bodies responsible for aviation and shipping respectively. 12 years later, nothing has really changed.  \n The EU has taken it\u2019s own action on aviation, the UK has taken on bold domestic targets, but at the end of the day, few countries are even willing to discuss it in the UN.  \n However, what has changed is the surrounding political environment.

Whilst bunkers remains a marginal issue (despite what others may say, the sectors collectively only represent about 3% of global emissions), this new political climate means that Copenhagen is the best chance of making progress on climate change as a whole and by extension, bunkers. The challenge is to move beyond our traditional position based posturing and actually start listening and thinking creatively about solving a \u2018wicked problem\u2019 that brings together a global environmental issue, global trade (and therefore development), global equity and equality and individual travel choices.

I smile sheepishly and watch as my tea takes shape. The cart is a filthy, ramshackle vehicle that wouldn\u2019t look out of place collecting rubbish on a London street. A large, battered tin kettle sits boiling away and the vendor sieves my tea out into a small, but clean glass cup. A dollop of condensed milk from a tin and my scalding hot beverage is ready \u2013 20 taka (less than 20p).

I gain a surprising sense of the former glory and the influence of this merchant family. The mediocre state of the building and the piles of litter in the garden are a sad reflection of the decline, but there is an unmistakable feeling of pride and a glimpse into Bangladeshi identity. There\u2019s so much more I want to learn about this history and heritage. I bump into a random French guy \u2013 the first foreigner I\u2019ve seen (outside of M\u2019s friends).

It\u2019s a bustling, energetic place with people scurrying around and bags of good shuttling on and off ferries. I stand and stare, watching the ballet of movement and commerce in action. For some reason, I\u2019m a little shy to draw my camera, so steal a few shots and hide my camera away lest I draw any more attention to myself. A couple of students engage me in a brief conversation \u2013 they\u2019re on their way to visit a friend, 4 hours away by boat.\n\n[![The last floods rose above this wall](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/10\/20090624_7728-200x133.jpg \"Dhaka water\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/10\/20090624_7728.jpg)The last floods rose above this wall\n\n\n\nWe stop for some more tea, then hop in a rickshaw back to the car and fight our way through traffic to Lalbagh fort. On the way, we pass along the river road, I ask Ali about the floods and how they affect Dhaka \u2013 he points out a wall and explains that the last proper floods in Dhaka saw water levels rise above it. The wall stands a good 8 feet above sea level and is itself about 6 feet. He casually explains that we\u2019re due for another flood and expects it in the next month or so.\n\n[![Lalbagh Fort](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090624_7729-200x133.jpg \"Lalbagh Fort\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090624_7729.jpg)Lalbagh Fort\n\n\n\nLalbagh Fort is an oasis of calm and tranquility amongst the hustle and bustle. It\u2019s an incomplete Mughal fortress initiated by the Viceroy of Bengal, who was subsequently recalled. His successor never finished the fortress as his daughter, Bibi Pari, died here. I don\u2019t really know much more about it, but again, is a glimpse of Bangladeshi heritage that I never really appreciated. The grounds are clean and well kept and offer a peaceful respite. Ali makes a comment to me as I head in that I don\u2019t understand, but after wandering for a while, I realise that this seems to be a spot in Dhaka where couples hide out amongst the small trees. Nothing obscene by our standards, but I wonder whether this is seen as a secret lovers garden and chuckle quietly to myself.\n\nOn the way back to pick up M from work, I reflect on what a different experience this would be for her, a white woman on her own and how very different her relationship with Ali is. Both because she is his employer, but also that she is a woman. I feel strangely privileged to be able to hang out with Ali and to be able to sit and drink tea with him \u2013 it\u2019s clearly a side of him and Dhaka that M will not get to see.\n\nMy day has been full of reflection and encounter. Old Dhaka is metaphorically and literally the heart of the city. The crazed flow of people and goods, the colourful rickshaws and crazy traffic, the smells, sights and sounds. I can see how it could be an overwhelming experience, a maelstrom of sensory overload, but I think you have to surrender to the chaos before you can finally sink in and enjoy it for the vibrant celebration of life that it truly is."},{"header":{"title":"Dhaka delights","slug":"dhaka-delights","date":"22-06-2009","published":true,"publish_date":"22-06-2009","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Itchy Feet"],"tag":["bangladesh","reflection","travel","bangladesh","reflection","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"Arrived in Dhaka at silly o\u2019clock having changed at Hong Kong.

Just as I made the decision in my head to come back, two amazing opportunities cropped up. Ironically neither result from the proverbial career irons I shoved in the fire (see earlier post [Why?](http:\/\/www.dkcy.com\/why \"Link to previous blog post\")), but both fill me with an excitement and passion that I haven\u2019t felt for a long time without being strapped to a snowboard.\n\nThey are similar in that they relate to climate change and how it can change the way we do things for the better. But they are both very different in terms of working environment, culture and future directions. They both tick the boxes of contribution to something meaningful and personal\/professional development.\n\nOne is at the nexus of climate change, business and the citizen-consumer. Hopefully I\u2019m not breaking any confidentiality agreements, but it is in a large retailer \u2013 a very large one, dealing mainly with UK food, but expanding internationally and in non-food (specifically finance). If I was to re-enter the corporate world, this would be the organisation, both in terms of scale of impact, culture and board-level leadership. The job has a real immediacy to it. It is a fast-paced world, where my actions would have real direct implications for hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The job is about addressing climate change in a commercial environment. For me, it would be a very challenging context \u2013 I would be surrounded by people who are not necessarily climate-oriented or interested in climate change for the same reasons as I am, but that\u2019s what makes this role absolutely at the heart of handling climate change in the real world.\n\nThe other, just as fair, is on another new frontier \u2013 the intersection between climate change, conflict and governance. Understanding how climate change links to conflict and using that to build peace \u2013 in particular, supporting inclusive, participatory approaches to decision-making as a central part of the solution to both challenges. Working in a very influential and well respected international NGO, with people who are passionate about the issues, have jobs driven by larger purpose and take time to consider the complexity of the problems. The role would be really engaging with the complexity of all three problems, through advocacy and direct contributions to real-world, on-the-ground projects in some very interesting and demanding places. It would have a longer-term, strategic bent,\u00c2\u00a0allowing me to grow into other areas that I care about\u00c2\u00a0and again, would be directly at the heart of my interest in climate change,\n\nPerhaps it comes back to the question of contribution. I feel like I have so much to give and have been trying to find where to give it, feeling that I just don\u2019t fit in the current job market \u2013 now suddenly there are two opportunities that fit me perfectly. I want to contribute to the changes that I feel are happening in the world, but where am I best placed to do it? But perhaps more importantly, which is right for me as an individual? My mind tells me that there is no such thing as a wrong decision, but I feel at a fork in the road and choosing a path is never simple.\n\nIt\u2019s made me think back to the first post I wrote about heading to New Zealand ([Thanks Bob](http:\/\/www.dkcy.com\/thanks-bob \"Link to previous post\") \u2013 the themes of that poem keep coming back to me!). \u201c*What am I hoping to get out of it? Space. Time. Freedom to think about what actually matters to me, about how I\u00e2&#128;&#153;d like to be remembered and about what the hell to do with myself and the precious gift of life.\u201d* I\u2019m beginning to feel like maybe I\u2019m getting a handle on those questions, and although the decision may be hard, what\u2019s important is that either of these jobs will help me along my road less travelled."},{"header":{"title":"Some other beginning&#8217;s end","slug":"some-other-beginnings-end","date":"13-06-2009","published":true,"publish_date":"13-06-2009","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["The Rat Race","\u51c4\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d (sugoi desu ne)"],"tag":["japan","lebenskrankheit","reflection","sustainability","japan","lebenskrankheit","reflection","sustainability"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"[![New shoots](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090430_6970-133x200.jpg \"Tulips by Lawson\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090430_6970.jpg)New shoots\n\n\n\nWell I\u2019ve been here in Japan for 5 months, the last 2 of which have been trying to sustain myself over the summer both financially and spiritually. And on both counts, I think it\u2019s time to call it a day. I\u2019ve decided to head back to the UK, temporarily, but depending on a few things, possibly for longer.\n\nOn reflection, at times, this has felt like a retreat, giving me space and perspective on the maelstrom of thoughts that filled my world (at other times, it\u2019s been quite the opposite!). But now, I feel like Rabbit has finally stopped talking and I\u2019m beginning to hear those 12 pots of Hunny calling me.\n\nI can no longer hide from the little nagging voice in my head that speaks of our interconnectedness and moral imperatives. As a good friend once said \u201cI\u2019ve stepped in my conscience and I can\u2019t seem to shake it off\u201d. I want to contribute, play my part in what is an exciting time for the world. And now I feel ready to return to more direct efforts to make this world a better place, armed with a clearer sense of direction \u2013 I\u2019m ready to channel my energy and experience into something bigger than myself.\n\nI still yearn to live in the mountains and continue to grow as a snowboarder, but I\u2019m confident that will resurface in future, probably in a different form. I\u2019ve spent the last 5 years juggling two worlds, and perhaps now is the time to keep my eye on the other ball.\n\nSo, where in the world does this put me? Well, I came here seeking a better quality of life and found it in some ways. But I miss my friends, my family, my community. They\u2019re all part of a well-balanced life and contribute to a sense of belonging, of meaning. I love meeting new people and discovering new places, but I miss some of the mundane, routine things that made up my life in London and I miss hanging out with old friends. So that points to being back in the UK again, but at the same time I\u2019m still not ready to fix myself in the UK and there\u2019s a world of opportunities out there. So time will tell as to where I end up (no surprises there then!).\n\n[![Douzo](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090521_7545-200x133.jpg \"The road ahead\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/20090521_7545.jpg)Douzo\n\n\n\nSome may see this decision as turning back, giving up.

The combination of reading the river, paddling and trying to entertain kids in a totally alien language is quite a challenge for me, but an enjoyable one. We play river games and the more excitable kids throw themselves in for a swim. The thing the kids love most is catching up to another boat and splashing them before paddling off again.

It\u2019s a very labour intensive process that I\u2019m sure could be more efficient, but that\u2019s the way we do it, so there\u2019s no questioning (another trait I\u2019ve noticed amongst my Japanese co-workers \u2013 there\u2019s a system, and that\u2019s the way we do it).\n\n[![Yotei from the river](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/20090510_7289-133x200.jpg \"Rafting with Yotei\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/20090510_7289.jpg)Yotei from the river\n\n\n\nThe kids sip hot tea before piling back on the the buses.

Last time I saw it, there was a good 3m of snow covering everything, so the verdant, agricultural landscape was quite a surprise. Shiori led us off into what turned out to be the golf course and we were soon ferreting around in the sassa grass (a type of bamboo).

I decided to stay out for the summer (cue [Dodgy](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XSUuRZR-9hA) \u2013 great video!) working as a rafting guide for [NOASC](http:\/\/www.noasc.com) (Niseko Outdoor Adventure Sports Company).\n\nWe\u2019re running two sections of \u00e5\u00b0\u00bb\u00e5&#136;\u00a5\u00e5\u00b7&#157; (*shiribetsu kawa* \u2013 *kawa* means river and Shiribetsu is its name. Although bizarrely *shiri* means arse and *betsu* means separate or different!!! I digress\u2026) \u2013 the easier summer (or Kutchan) course and the spring (or Niseko) course further downstrem.\n\nIt\u2019s been interesting to learn something new and having only rafted once before (in Switzerland), was definitely a challenge! The first few weeks of training were pretty cold, trudging through snow to reach the river \u2013 but it also meant that we got to slide down the banks on the rafts!\n\nOur first milestone was the River Association of Japan (RAJ) exam \u2013 where we were tested on basic raft control skills (forward\/back paddle, front\/back sweep, sculling, drawstroke), flip recovery (climb onto, re-right and climb back onto an overturned raft in less than a minute) and throwbag (hit a 2m-wide target from 12m away with a rescue rope). It turned out to be a pretty easy exam and we all passed it.\n\nSo now we\u2019re in the final stages of our training where we need approval to raft on the two separate courses that we run. Here\u2019s where we begin to run into some difficulties.\n\n[![Splash!](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/20090423_04-13-200x133.jpg \"Splash\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/20090423_04-13.jpg)Splash!\n\n\n\nFirstly \u2018approval\u2019 is a pretty ill defined goal, essentially being a totally subjective evaluation from one of the senior guides. There are specific requirements, but even though I\u2019ve fulfilled them, I still haven\u2019t passed.\n\nSecondly, not being an approved commercial guide means that despite the fact that we are essentially guiding, we\u2019re only being paid a daily training allowance of 1000 yen which we can only collect at the end of the season. Hmm. Seems a bit of a rip off.\n\nFunnily enough, this has not been a motivating factor for me and as a result I\u2019ve not really rafted much since the RAJ exam. There does appear to be light at the end of the tunnel in the shape of paid work on the 11th May, but the long term prospects seem a little grim.

Midori no hi (\u00e3&#129;\u00bf\u00e3&#129;\u00a9\u00e3&#130;&#138;\u00e3&#129;\u00ae\u00e6&#151;\u00a5, Greenery Day, April 29), kenpou kinenbi (\u00e6&#134;\u00b2\u00e6\u00b3&#149;\u00e8\u00a8&#152;\u00e5\u00bf\u00b5\u00e6&#151;\u00a5, Constitutional Memorial Day, May 3), kokumin no kyuujitsu (\u00e5&#155;\u00bd\u00e6\u00b0&#145;\u00e3&#129;\u00ae\u00e4\u00bc&#145;\u00e6&#151;\u00a5, Citizen\u2019s Holiday, May 4) and finally kodomo no hi (\u00e3&#129;&#147;\u00e3&#129;\u00a9\u00e3&#130;&#130;\u00e3&#129;\u00ae\u00e6&#151;\u00a5, Children\u2019s Day) \u2013 today.\n\nUntil 1948, the 5th day of the 5th month was known as tango no sekku (\u00e7\u00ab\u00af\u00e5&#141;&#136;\u00e3&#129;\u00ae\u00e7\u00af&#128;\u00e5&#143;\u00a5). Tan means edge or \u2018start of\u2019 and go represents the 7th sign of the zodiac, which corresponds to the month of May. Sekku means seasonal festival. So it translates as a start of season (spring) festival and in ancient times was a celebration of new beginnings. But tango no sekku has come to mean Boy\u2019s Festival \u2013 an auspicious day when parents pray for the health and success of their sons.\n\nThe carp was chosen as it is seen as the most spirited of fish, able to power its way up fast-flowing streams. It stands for courage and success in the face of adversity and is a symbol of manliness and the overcoming of life\u2019s difficulties.\n\nPS It\u2019s interesting that although it\u2019s been redesignated as Children\u2019s Day, it still remains dominated by the *tango no sekku* traditions. There is a separate girls\u2019 day, but it doesn\u2019t have anywhere near as cool flags \u00f0&#159;&#153;&#130;"},{"header":{"title":"Japan thru a Holga lens","slug":"japan-thru-a-holga-lens","date":"16-04-2009","published":true,"publish_date":"16-04-2009","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["\u51c4\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d (sugoi desu ne)"],"tag":["japan","photography","synchronicity","japan","photography","synchronicity"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"[![Holga 120](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/holga_120_gcfn-200x159.jpg \"Holga 120\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/holga_120_gcfn.jpg)Was browsing the web a bit today and came across [Holga cameras](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Holga). Basically, they\u2019re cheap and cheerful Chinese cameras that were intended to provide a cheap, mass-market camera for the working class. Their poor quality produces amazing, ethereal photos with vignetting, screwed up colours and contrast. Light leaks create colour distortions and the simple lens blurs the edges of images.

After a fumbled Japanese exchange, I bowed out (literally) and wandered off down the road. Next stop was Jam Cafe, not an izakaya, but somewhere that was supposed to be quite good and cheap. I hestitated at the door, then abandoned it as it felt too touristy and bar-like.  \n Trundling down the snowy road, my jeans getting wetter and wetter, I almost walked past the enormous sign saying Izakaya Raku. Nervously sliding the door open (after a failed attempt on the wrong side!), I greet the staff and try to ask if I can eat something. My japanese fails me and I end up just saying \u201ceat\u201d and pointing at myself like a dislocated Tarzan. It works, and I\u2019m soon sitting at the bar by the chef.  \n Exploring the menu (in Japanese, but fortunately with pictures), I bravely try to ask what the special is (kore wa nan desuka) and get a long-winded response that is succintly boiled down to \u201csalmon pickles\u201d. Unable to decide if this is salmon sashimi with pickles or some sort of weird japanese pickled salmon, I bottle it and order maguro sashimi (raw tuna), edamame (boiled soy beans), miso shiro (white miso soup), gohan (rice) and nihon shu (japanese sake). The waiter seems to understand and passes my order to the kitchen as I breathe a sigh of relief and take a look around.  \n The place is pretty much empty, in contrast to the packed mainstream venues. 3 japanese girls sit in the corner chatting and giggling quietly. There\u2019s a bar round the small galley kitchen and several other tables. 4 staff (that look more like samurai than chefs) are busy preparing food. Short banners hang all around with various menu items scrawled in japanese. Some cool chilled out Japanese funk\/soul beats. The counter is a light pine and the floor a dark wood of some sort, it feels very natural and warm.  \n My food arrives and I politely say itadakimasu (a standard phrase that japanese say before they eat). I plonk wasabi into a dish and pour shoyou (soy sauce) over it, before deciding that I should tip it all on my rice. I give the hot rice a mix and eagerly shovel some into my mouth with chopsticks. About a millisecond later, my sinuses are burning as I underestimate the strength of the wasabi. I fight back the tears and only just manage to refrain from exploding rice across the counter and my laptop. Fortunately the pain subsides and I manage to enjoy the rest of my meal, nibbling each different taste neatly and sighing contentedly after each bite.  \n Taking a look at the menu, it looks like the whole meal will cost me around 1500 yen (about a tenner) \u2013 not the cheapest, but a heck of a lot cheaper than other restaurants and a damn sight nicer. Rather pleased with myself, I toddle off back to Unitas, a little wobbly from the sake, but filled with sashimi and a sense of achievement.  \n EDIT: And on the way back, I missed my bus, but got a hitch from Lina and Cleo from Niseko Gourmet \u2013 nice!"},{"header":{"title":"Ja-pow","slug":"ja-pow","date":"15-01-2009","published":true,"publish_date":"15-01-2009","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["\u51c4\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d (sugoi desu ne)"],"tag":["instructing","powder","snow","instructing","powder","snow"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"Unitas dining hall, large can of Asahi in hand  \n It snowed today.

Food-wise there\u2019s been a definite improvement here, we\u2019re now getting Japanese food twice a week and the other meals have been much better. Still pretty school canteen, but OK.  \n Work\u2019s been good too, had my first lesson this season (a nice English girl who\u2019s just on her way back to the UK from 6 months in Toyko)\u00c2\u00a0 and been figuring out how the school works. At the moment there doesn\u2019t seem to be a huge amount of work to go round, but it\u2019ll get busier at Chinese New Year. Met up with Tiktak last night, which was cool. Turns out that NISS named our kids program after her. Pretty cool I thought. Been getting to know others at work and feeling quite good about things now. We have training every Monday and Wednesday \u2013 so far I\u2019ve just been doing the ski training cos I want to do my Level 2 exam in Feb, but judging by tonight\u2019s performance, I might think twice about that!\n\n[![Jagatakun, Kutchan's town mascot](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/jagatakun.jpg \"Jagatakun\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/jagatakun.jpg)Jagatakun, Kutchan's town mascot\n\n\n\nWent to Kutchan today to register for my geijin card, a card that foreigners have to get if they stay for more than 90 days \u2013 lets me get a bank account etc. Should have one up and running soon.

It had only just started, so I pottered over for breakfast and chatted to people. Kurokawa, our friendly repairman, came and sorted out the heating and I headed to the mountain. Met Tom, the operations manager at the ski school who was very friendly and professional. Then went for a ride \u2013 there was about an inch on the ground and it was coming down thick and fast now.\n\n![Snow clearing: Niseko-style.

I\u2019ve had probs with it before, and I guess cos my muscles aren\u2019t up to strength yet, it\u2019s putting more strain on my ligaments, I\u2019m gonna strap it and take it easy. Hopefully it\u2019s nothing major, but it\u2019s a worrying start.  \n So I\u2019m back here, having found a van that sold gyu-don (bowl of rice with beef and pickles) for a mere 650 yen (about a fiver).

The bus took a brief stop at a 24 hour toilet and I got to experience the delights of a heated toilet seat. On the way back out, there was a vending machine selling coffee and hot chocolate in cans! The best invention ever! Sat at the back of the bus drinking hot coffee and grinning smugly.  \n Arrived at Hirafu late (about 10.30pm) and was met by Kate (one of the ski supervisors), who took me to my accommodation in Unitas, where I met Francis, a friendly Singaporean guy that lives in Australia and is my new roommate.

Niseko is divided into 4 areas, from West to East: Ann\u2019puri, Niseko Village (renamed from Higayashima), Hirafu and Hanazono. I\u2019ll be working at Hanazono and Hirafu. It\u2019s a medium sized place, easy to get around and looks like a good place to learn and to teach. It hasn\u2019t snowed for a few days, so it\u2019s surprisingly scratchy in places \u2013 but I found some trees on the leeward side that had held the windblown snow. Was nice to dust off my snowlegs \u2013 although my first few runs were a bit ropey!  \n Rather randomly bumped into Sam and Sara at breakfast \u2013 Sam worked at Winter Park with me and Sara joined him the year after. Was nice to see some familiar faces, which took the edge of the scary loneliness!  \n Food is an interesting challenge here \u2013 I was really looking forward to lots of yummy Japanese food, but my (expensive) rent includes food here, which is basic, stodgy Western food :(. At lunch I had an explore and found that most places cost an absolute fortune and the food didn\u2019t look that great. But I found Seicomart (a supermarket type place) and they had triangular rice ball things for 100 yen (less than a quid). I put my hiragana skills to the test and did quite well in deciphering the labels. Wasabi-nori for me then. It\u2019s a little frustrating to not have a kitchen, cos I reckon you could eat well very cheaply here by buying fresh food from Seicomart and cooking it yourself. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure something out \u2013 have already bought miso and genmaicha!  \n So I\u2019m here now. It\u2019s not quite what I expected, but then what did I expect?

A lot. It lets me be creative (literally and figuratively) and connects me to my food. And most importantly, I end up with something yummy to eat (most of the time!).  \n Lots of people who\u2019ve sampled my culinary experiments have asked for recipes, so I thought I\u2019d start blogging on food. The problem is I don\u2019t tend to follow recipes \u2013 I look at them to get ideas and inspiration, but most of the time I get an idea then just make something up (usually cos I don\u2019t like, haven\u2019t got or can\u2019t be bothered to get a particular ingredient).

In my family, it tends to get turned into a turkey curry or turkey muay (sort of Teochew rice porridge, also known as congee). But this year, I thought I\u2019d try something different. Given that I\u2019m heading off to Japan soon, I\u2019ve been learning how to make my favourite Japanese foods, one of which is udon (fat, wheat noodles). Udon, like most noodles, are quite versatile, chuck \u2019em in soups, stir-fry them, put them in salads or the Japanese like to have them cold with a dressing. You don\u2019t have to make your noodles from scratch, you can buy them from most asian stores and a few English supermarkets, but I\u2019m on a quest to learn how to make grain based staples, so I made my own \u2013 more on that another time.\n\n#### Noodles\n\n- 250g flour\n- 150ml water\n- 1 tsp of salt\n\n1. Dissolve the salt in the water. Sift the flour into a big bowl and slowly stir the salt water in.\n2. As the dough comes together, start using your fingers to roll it in the remaining loose flour and squeeze it. Once it\u2019s picked up all the flour and is a consistent lump, knead it for a few minutes on a floured surface until it feels elastic.\n3. Flatten it slightly and let it rest for a few hours in some clingfilm \u2013 this lets the gluten do something or other and makes it more elastic. I like to sandwich it between a large piece of folded clingfilm. Go make your soup. Chop chop.\n4. Bring a big pot of water to the boil while you roll your noodles out.\n5. Once the dough has rested, it\u2019s time to roll it out \u2013 the fun part. Now because the dough will be quite firm, the traditional Japanese way of rolling it out is to tread on it! The warmth of your feet and your weight make life a lot easier. I keep it between a piece of folded clingfilm (give it lots of room!) and put it in a clean plastic bag, drop it on the floor and start walking!\n6. Once you\u2019ve got it quite spread out (and before it squeezes out all over your feet and the floor!), unwrap it and lay it out on a floured surface. Dust a bit of flour on it and roll it out so that it\u2019s even and about 5mm thick (or however thick you want your noodles).\n7. Flour the dough well so it doesn\u2019t stick to itself and fold the top 1\/3 towards you and the bottom 1\/3 away from you so it gives you 3 layers. Using a sharp knife, through the layers thinly (or as fat as you want your noodles). I usually go for about 3-5mms.\n8. Separate your noodles carefully and lob them into the boiling water for a few minutes to cook. Once they\u2019re cooked, drain them and rinse them in cold water to stop them sticking \u2013 magic!\n\n#### Soup\n\n- 1\/2 onion or some shallots\n- 1 chilli (optional)\n- 1-2 cloves of garlic (optional)\n- Chicken stock\n- Soy sauce\n- Sesame oil\n\nThis is quite a generic soup recipe, it changes everytime I make it, but this time I wanted a bit of a kick, so put chilli in. If you\u2019re in a rush, or not keen on strong flavours, then you can just use chicken stock (but that\u2019s boring!!).\n\n#### To serve\n\n- Udon noodles\n- Soup base\n- Leftover meat\n- Pak choi or other leafy veg (spinach, lettuce, choi sum, etc)\n- Garnishings e.g. spring onions, bawang goreng (crispy fried shallots \u2013 yum), coriander, dash of sesame oil\n\n1. Bring the soup to the boil, add noodles and veg. I like a bit of bite to my veg, so I don\u2019t cook it for long.\n2. Cut up the meat and add it to the soup to heat up (you don\u2019t want to cook it so that it\u2019s chewy).\n3. Serve it into bowls and add some garnish.

Having been back in the UK for 18 months, trying to lead a \u2018normal\u2019 life, I finally had enough of office life, for a whole host of reasons. One way to sum it up is that I feel out of sync with the conventional workplace. A square peg in a grid of round holes. Stifled. But the most simple explanation is that it was making me miserable. Deeply so. So I\u2019m leaving that life, sort of. I am torn between two worlds \u2013 one of trying to make a difference, change the world or whatever; the other about following my heart and seeking personal fulfillment. Is it possible to find a balance?\n\nFor me, the only course of action was to do something that makes my heart sing and keep open to opportunities. So I decided to go back to the mountains, shoved some proverbial career irons in the fire and let life take its course. Having applied late, I wasn\u2019t very hopeful \u2013 then I got offered not one, but two jobs in Japan. I had one of those life moments where everything just falls into place to make something happen. Within 2 weeks, I had a job, booked my flight, let my flat out and got my visa. Fate? Wu wei wu? Chance? Does it matter \u2013 I\u2019m off to a land with an average of 15m of snow each season! A land of bonsai, sushi, origami, cherry blossoms \u2013 all things I love \u2013 and finally getting the motivation to learn the language. Rock on. Sugoi desu ne?\n\nWhat happens after the season?

Well, I\u2019m gonna try and embrace the blogging tradition (is it one yet?) and blog more regularly, hopefully with slightly less esoteric updates and more trivial blatherings from my abstract mind."},{"header":{"title":"Final days in Kathmandu","slug":"final-days-in-kathmandu","date":"13-11-2008","published":true,"publish_date":"13-11-2008","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Itchy Feet"],"tag":["nepal","travel","nepal","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"![View from Helena's](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/20081112_46961-200x133.jpg \"Helena's\")View from Helena's\n\n\n\nA leisurely final day together \u2013 breakfast at the dizzying heights of Helena\u2019s, some shopping and late lunch\/dinner at Pilgrim\u2019s feed n read.

I write and read a little, happy to have been recognised by the staff. Invited to music later. I wander Thamel and buy a bansuri, spend some time in the store playing guitar and thwacking drums. Wander off feeling blissfully happy and carefree.\n\nTry to get an electric Safa Tempo, but get conned onto a normal tempo to Boudnath. 15 rupees later, having been squeezed into the low roof Suzuki, I spill out in front of Boudnath stupa. I pay 100 rupees for entry and get given a leaflet, before realising it\u2019s free. It\u2019s pretty, but no real connection, I spy a roof top cafe and seek it out.\n\n![Watchful eyes](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/20081113_47501-200x133.jpg \"Buddha eyes\")Watchful eyes\n\n\n\nThe Saturday Cafe fills a spot and I sit, read and write, eavesdropping on conversations high about the stupa.

The monks speak great english, I slip my flip-flops off and slide through the curtain.\n\n15 pairs of eyes swivel in my direction, still chanting.\n\nI feel very out of place. Nervously namaste-ing, I creep in. A monk motions for me to sit just as a huge cacophony starts. The tantric drums pound through my body. I sit transfixed and gradually settle into the experience. I scatter rice as the monks perform full body prostrations. Then comes a point in the puja where something is poured into the monks\u2019 hands, they sip it then wipe it on their shorn heads. A monk approaches and pours some of the bright yellow liquid into my hand. I follow suit and wonder what I\u2019ve just consumed. Later they offer me bread (that is familiar to me as yau char kway) and some sort of hot drink \u2013 maybe involving yak butter. It\u2019s sweet and warm, but looks like dish water. Unsure whether it\u2019s right for me to take part, I decide to accept as an acknowledgement of our interconnectedness. Puja finishes and I\u2019m swept into a sea of locals circumambulating the stupa. Dazzled and intrigued, I finally head back to Kathmandu.\n\n![Dusk at Boudnath](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/20081113_47671-200x133.jpg \"Dusk at Boudnath\")Dusk at Boudnath\n\n\n\nI visit Pilgrims\u2019, intent on chilling to sitar music, but something doesn\u2019t feel right.

Still, I soon sink into it, gripping bars with grubby feet. It\u2019s windy and the temperature begins to drop. A few flecks of rain cause momentary panic, but the downpour never materialises.\n\nWe arrive at Naya Pul \u2013 a collection of shacks. A rather scrappy dismount and hasty booting up, then we are left in the relative quiet. We follow Dave and Sir to find the path to Birethanti, a pleasant and well equipped village that represents the real start of the trek.\n\n![View from Indra Guesthouse](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/20081105_4385-200x300.jpg \"View from Indra guesthouse\")View from Indra Guesthouse\n\n\n\nA long day of steep trekking and some confused map-reading.

Off to Pokhara and realised what that great cheap deal bought us, passing neat and clean buses to arrive, mildly despondent at a rickety green bus.

Strange mix of sadhus, a 5-legged cow, pigeons, fat Americans, svelte locals, eager hawkers and some very out of place teenage girls.

Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan of random animation and indeed of \u2018O Brother Where Art Thou\u2019, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve come to expect from my own front page. I\u2019ve never been hacked before and I have to say it was an unpleasant experience that left me feeling violated, yet I also found it strangely exhilarating \u2013 like a hidden assailant had slapped my face and thrown down the virtual gauntlet, daring me to figure out how they did it. So, never one to back down from a challenge, I duly got out my best deerstalker and began some detective work.\n\n### Elementary, my dear Watson\n\nFirst thing was to start from the evidence at the scene of the crime \u2013 checking the source code of the defaced page, I could see that it linked to another page. So I had a wee look (http:\/\/www.caprazates.org\/ \u2013 not sure I should really give them the pleasure of a link, but hey) \u2013 which leads to a Turkish website (if anyone could translate, it would be much appreciated \u2013 Babelfish only goes so far!). Great, well now I knew my assailant\u2019s identity, but it didn\u2019t take me any further. So it was back to the drawing board.\n\nOk, so they\u2019d basically changed my main template to show their stupid page. How had they done this? Well, it was one of 3 things:\n\n1. I\u2019d done something stupid and left permissions open for them to upload a file\n2. My web hosts (<a>Easily<\/a>) had done something stupid and left a hold for them to upload a file\n3. The CMS I\u2019m using ([Joomla](http:\/\/www.joomla.org)) has a security hole\n\nThe most likely option to me, as an amateur systems administrator, was that I had done something stupid, but I thought I\u2019d check Easily and Joomla\u2019s forums for any indications. After some digging, I found out that there was indeed a security flaw with Joomla (http:\/\/developer.joomla.org\/security\/news\/241-20080801-core-password-remind-functionality.html). Haha! Relieved it wasn\u2019t my fault, I breathed a sigh of relief. Now to figure out what they did\n\nWell I knew from the date of the defaced page that the perps (always wanted to use that word \u2013 CSI is an educational programme) were in around 16th August at 1.37am, so I checked my web logs and indeed found some miscreant had come in and messed stuff around. Without getting techy, they basically changed my password, logged into the site and changed the front page. Bastards.\n\n### The moral of the story\n\nSo having solved the mystery of my hackage and the intellectual challenge, my thoughts turned to justice (actually, they turned to revenge first, but then I thought probably best not to take on people who do this sort of stuff \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like poking a bully in the chest). In the absence of internet police, what could I do? I couldn\u2019t have the person arrested. I couldn\u2019t fine them. I couldn\u2019t even ring them up and shout down the phone. All I could really do was email them a strongly worded message, which I didn\u2019t really want to do in case they tried something nastier on my site. I felt like I\u2019d been mugged, but had retrieved my belongings, so somehow that\u2019s ok and my mugger could go on doing what they liked.\n\nThoughts drifted to self-pity \u2013 Why me? How did they find me? Was it random? Or was it a deliberate plot against me in particular? It turns out they had used Google to find a specific page on my site and then hacked in. They must have gone through hitting other sites on the list and I was just another. So I didn\u2019t even have the dignity of being a specific target. I was just another anonymous site on the shopping list of someone with too much time on their hands.\n\nSo where did that leave me? I was on a hitlist, I\u2019d been hit, but I knew what had happened and had fixed the problem. So now what? I now knew enough to go and hack someone else\u2019s website. Oooh, the mischief I could cause\u2026 but NO, then I\u2019d be as bad as them \u2013 worse even, cos I didn\u2019t even come up with it myself. Instead, and in a small attempt to live up to Gandhian ideals, I decided I should beat this virtual sword into a ploughshare (although that\u2019s a biblical quote, so I\u2019m mixing my philosophy here!).\n\nSo, in \u2018My Name is Earl\u2019 style, I\u2019m working through my list and letting them all know. If you\u2019re running a site using Joomla 1.5, then I suggest you [upgrade to Joomla 1.5.6](http:\/\/www.joomla.org\/announcements\/release-news\/5199-joomla-156-released.html) ASAP.

So, I\u2019ve started my MA in Sustainable Enterprise and one of the things I wanted to do was write a blog of the experience and my personal journey through it. I\u2019m now three days in and my head feels like it\u2019s about to explode.\n\nI\u2019ve got so much to say, but I\u2019m just not sure how to express it in a readable way! I guess starting from the start is a good way. So the MA is run through Coventry University\u2019s Applied Research Centre for Human Security. What is human security I hear you ask? Good question \u2013 I won\u2019t give an academic answer, but I guess it\u2019s about an approach to global security that focusses on individuals rather than nation states. So instead of security being about maintaining your borders and repelling invaders, it\u2019s about individuals\u2019 sense of security and well-being. Freedom from fear, access to resources \u2013 the room to grow and develop as a human being.\n\nThe course itself is looking at the role of enterprise (any sort of organisation, be it business, charity, NGO or government) in human security and sustainability. It\u2019s hard to summarise in a short sentence, and I\u2019m eager to blurt out what\u2019s rattling round my brain, I guess at it\u2019s core is a question about the relative roles and responsibilities of government, business and civil society. It\u2019s about understanding what sustainable enterprise is and what a sustainable enterprise economy looks like.\n\nI think that\u2019s enough of an intro, I apologise that it\u2019s not particularly thorough and it\u2019s not meant to be a comprehensive explanation, just a brief blurb off the top of my head. Anyways, so I\u2019m here with some amazing people with really diverse backgrounds and approaches to life. It\u2019s fantastic to be involved in this with these people. One of the things that Malcolm (McIntosh, who heads up ARCHS) and his team have adopted is a conversational learning approach, where we share in the co-creation of knowledge and understanding. In plain English \u2013 we talk about stuff and through it we learn and about each other and ourselves.\n\nI\u2019m here as part of my journey and general existential angst. I guess I\u2019ve been interested in lots of this stuff for a while and the approach they\u2019re adopting here, I guess 3 things in particular are unique to this course and perfect for me:\n\n- A transdisciplinary approach to issues of globalisation, sustainability and social justice\n- Complexity \u2013 seeing the world as a complex adaptive system\n- An approach of creating knowledge through letting things go, through non-directed, conversational learning. One could call it the Tao\n\nIt\u2019s been phenomenal to be immersed in this world with such creative and diverse people and really get my teeth into so many of these issues. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this and finally feel armed enough to really get stuck in.\n\nSo many thoughts and ideas, I can\u2019t really do them justice here. I guess they\u2019ll fall out of my head into this blog over time, but just to try and capture some.\n\n**What does it mean to be human?** One of the core themes that keep re-appearing is that of \u201cwhat it means to be human\u201d. Instinctively this means connections and the desire to connect \u2013 with each other, with our environment and ourself. It\u2019s also about the ability to choose. Between positive and negative. I\u2019m really interested in exploring this question and in particular about the role of energy in what it means to be human.\n\n**Complexity and Buddhist economics** Another thought was about seeing sustainable enterprise as being about the long-term future of an organisation, enabling it to continue what it does ad infinitum and then taking Schumacher\u2019s buddhist economics and asking \u2013 what if the role of corporations is to provide meaningful work? And progress was about doing thing better but not necessarily bigger. What world the world look like if we all enjoyed work and were truly content with it? Wouldn\u2019t that create productivity, creativity and innovation? So, what if we saw sustainable enterprise as:\n\n- creating work that people enjoy\n- within planetary limits\n- as a complex adaptive system that is organisationally closed, but energetically open?\n\n**The Black Gold Market** We\u2019ve just watched *Black Gold*, a fascinating documentary about the inequities and complexities of the global coffee market. One of the key points was about how low the coffee price was and how it is determined by New York traders. It got me thinking \u2013 why is the price so low? I\u2019d be really interested to take my experience and knowledge of the emissions trading market and investigate coffee. What are the price fundamentals and what\u2019s driving the low? How could farmers engage in the market (directly or indirectly) to influence it?\n\n**Action research as an instrument of change** Coventry Uni is building a new climate change institute. ARCHS have tried to engage with them to get them to build it sustainably, using all the skills on offer at the Uni. They\u2019ve not been able to convince the Uni to do so for a whole host of complex reasons \u2013 what are they? Are they perceived or real? How could they be overcome? What role do individuals and individual attitudes have to play in this? Could I achieve change by asking these research questions?\n\n**Thai synchronicity** In another great example of synchronicity and serendipity \u2013 I\u2019m off to Thailand (courtesy of my cousin Chris) to explore opportunities out there. Given their proximity to and relationship with Myanmar\/Burma and the complexity of corporate citizenship in that context, it would be fascinating to look into that in more detail. What approach do supra-territorial corporations take to corporate citizenship in Thailand? What role do they have in terms of how Thailand engages with the Myanmar\/Burma situation? What role do Thai businesses take in that? How does all of that relate to the inter-governmental relationship?

Well I guess starting from where I am is appropriate. I\u2019m down at Ade\u2019s in Cornwall, hanging out and stepping out of my life to try and get some perspective.\n\nSince being back I feel like I\u2019ve slipped into a hole. I\u2019m back in London and nothing\u2019s changed, but everything\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve been working my ass off in my job, getting paid more than I\u2019ve ever been paid before and doing tremendously well (just been given a pay rise \u2013 not bad for 4 months work). But I\u2019ve lost something along the way. Coming back was harder than I could possible have imagined. Yet the hardest part was that I didn\u2019t even realise it.\n\nIt took an insane week of what seemed like my whole world crumbling around me to realise where I was. I realised that I needed to do something about it. I realised that Jen and I had gone as far as we could together and it was time to part ways \u2013 something I never thought would happen, but did. Immensely difficult, but at the same time right. It\u2019s been horrible to deal with and the feeling of guilt is overwhelming sometimes. Trying to sort out stupid practical things has added to this. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we\u2019ll both see that it is the right thing. We\u2019ve had an amazing time together and nothing can change that or take that away.\n\nSo I\u2019m homeless at the moment, staying at Hywel and Jo\u2019s in Brixton (thanks guys!) and pondering my fate. Yet somehow, life feels like it\u2019s turned a bit of a corner. I feel I\u2019ve realised something and things are gradually coming back down and falling into place. The job is getting better (but still uncertain), I\u2019ve been doing lots of new things (screenwriting, tango, going to the theatre, surfing) and feeling free. I\u2019ve just had an offer accepted on a lovely flat in Brixton and that seems to be working out.\n\nBut that\u2019s all short term \u2013 I\u2019m still a little lost as to where I\u2019m going and am trying to get back to just being. Something that\u2019s eluded me for a while and the more I chase it, the further it gets. I look back over the last few years of life and have accomplished so much, but at the same time I haven\u2019t moved at all on my spiritual journey. I feel like I\u2019ve suddenly realised this and this feels like a transition, an awakening and period of growth. I\u2019ll come through the other side and will have learnt something, but at the moment, I feel lost and doubtful.\n\nSo much has happened in the last few months that I can\u2019t make sense of it. Coming here was supposed to be a break away and a chance to reflect and to just be. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m capable of that at the moment, but I have to accept what life throws me and try to roll with it. Get back to the flow and rhythm.

Then suddenly it was over and Jen and I went our separate ways to the same place(!?). The flight home was very surreal, after managing to get all our luggage (and it was a LOT!) onto planes, I failed to sleep for the 11 flying hours, being sandwiched against a window and a fat Indian man whose arms squished over the controls for the in-flight entertainment. Then circling in a holding pattern over London and the most impressive approach to Heathrow I\u2019ve seen, dropping past the Millenium Dome and right the way over Central London.

Even though I\u2019ve got no consultancy experience, they\u2019re really keen on me and want to put me through my paces in the first few months, with some fast track training and development. I\u2019ve been thinking about it over the weekend and decided to take it, so I\u2019ll be starting on the 1st May.

Anyways, life\u2019s beginning to take shape for us here now after quite a tumultuous month. Things have been quite tough on both of us; work for Jen hasn\u2019t been great and she\u2019s not as into the snow lifestyle as I am. It\u2019s been made harder by the contrast with how much I\u2019m enjoying myself and how well work has been going for me. It\u2019s been even tougher cos we\u2019ve been trying to adjust to being in a new country and moving into a new place, plus the lack of phone and internet access means we\u2019ve been a little cut off!\n\nBut things are much better now, Jen\u2019s been making the most of being here and getting out there more. She\u2019s been enjoying skiing much more (snowboarding is on hold for the moment!) and has been shadowing kids skiing lessons. Plus now we\u2019ve got internet and a PO Box, so contact with other people is much easier. Ronnie came out over New Year and I think that helped Jen get a bit of perspective on things and appreciate life here for what it is. It\u2019s still tough for her, but things are getting better!\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1169610687_img_2219-300x199.jpg \"Rockies\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1169610687_img_2219.jpg)Anyways, now we\u2019ve both got two days off a week (Tue and Wed) \u2013 most mornings I have clinics at 8am. For me, morning line-up is at 9.30 (when we find out if we\u2019ve got work or not) \u2013 I\u2019m teaching adults so work is either at Sorensen Park (total beginners), Plaza (upper level lessons) or Burton Learn to Ride (4.5 hour all day lessons for total beginners). I usually finish my morning lesson at 12 and then have to be back at afternoon line-up at 12.30 \u2013 but by the time I get down from the mountain, I\u2019m normally left with about 15 mins for lunch, so it\u2019s a little rushed!\n\nSometimes I get privates (I had quite a lot over the holidays) \u2013 it\u2019s less pay, but generally better tips and you get to give more personal attention. But overall, LTRs are my favourite as you get to spend all day with the same people and can take more time to develop skills.\n\nWork has been really quiet after the Xmas rush \u2013 so I\u2019ve been learning to ski and to instruct skiing. Got myself a brand new pair of Salomon Foil freestyle skis for a great price and have been loving it! Other than that, I\u2019ve been working on my riding \u2013 riding a lot of park and had a few clinics on the halfpipe and bumps. We\u2019ve got some great trainers here, including Chris Hargrave who wrote the AASI book on freestyle. After a clinic with him, I\u2019ve learnt to frontside lipslide on boxes and actually enjoy riding rails now!\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1169610687_img_2220-199x300.jpg \"Jen with books\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1169610687_img_2220.jpg)The snow here is out of this world \u2013 we had a huge storm before Christmas and had about 20 inches of snow in 24 hours. Cos it\u2019s so dry here, the snow is really light and powdery \u2013 perfect for riding! The only problem is that I have to dig my car out of snow from time to time and driving can be a little sketchy at times. It\u2019s also bloody cold here \u2013 the last few days have been around -38 Farenheit. But things are warming up now and blue sky has returned!\n\nSo, life is going well here \u2013 I\u2019ve got a car now (a 1991 Subaru Legacy), which makes it easier to get out of resort and visit Denver or Boulder. In fact, we\u2019re heading to Boulder tomorrow (over the Berthoud Pass, which people seem to think is scary, but they obviously haven\u2019t been on NZ roads!)."},{"header":{"title":"Rocky Mountain High","slug":"rocky-mountain-high","date":"18-12-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"18-12-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Rocky Mountain High"],"tag":["snow","winter park","snow","winter park"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"**17th December 2006, 20:24**  \n*The McKellar\u2019s*\n\nWell, it\u2019s been a crazy few days!

Determined not to despair, I smiled politely and wandered off muttering \u201cI will get on this flight, I will get on this flight\u201d.\n\nAt check-in, my snowboard bag was way overweight and they said I couldn\u2019t take it on the plane. After much pleading and patience, a lovely lady called Yvonne eventually let me repack another bag and pay an excess fee. Problem was, I didn\u2019t have another bag, so off I ran to buy a new one.\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00278.jpg \"My boarding pass\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00278.jpg)Anyways, I had to wait around for an hour to find out if I could get a seat. Somehow, I got the last seat on the flight and went racing off to pay my departure fee and clear security. It took forever cos you get checked 3 times and the whole way I was checking my watch. So as I cleared security (having had my lip balm confiscated!) there were only a few minutes left, so I raced to an internet machine, emailed Jen to let her know and booked myself on a flight from LA to Denver \u2013 the same one as Jen! I got to the gate and fortunately, the flight was delayed, which meant I could get on it. I have never been so happy to be on a plane!\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00279.jpg \"Me with boarding pass\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00279.jpg)The flight was late coming into LA, which meant that I had an hour to get my next flight \u2013 so I raced round the airport and was first in line at immigration (never had that before!), only to have to wait an hour for my bags! So I missed the flight by about a minute. Damn.\n\nBut Qantas rebooked me on the next flight for free and waived the excess baggage fee for me \u2013 they even gave me $15 to buy food with (I\u2019ll still never fly with them again!). So, Jen had no idea I was coming and neither did Ann and Gordon (Amy\u2019s parents \u2013 who were picking Jen up). I had no idea what I was going to do in Denver and I couldn\u2019t get hold of Ann or Gordon. So I rang my mum and asked her to email Jen to let her know and then jumped on the flight.\n\nHanging around meant that I met a few snow bum types and got chatting with Andy \u2013 a kiwi originally, but is now a permanent resident in Vail of all places. We ended up on the same flight and sat next to each other, gassing all the way. I was talking about what I was going to do when I arrived and he said \u201cNo worries! My friend Allie\u2019s picking me up, she\u2019ll drop you in Boulder on the way\u201d \u2013 the kindness of strangers never ceases to impress!\n\nIn the end it all worked out, cos Allie let me call and I managed to get hold of Gordon. Allie dropped me at a gas station, where Gordon was waiting with Jen!\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00280.jpg \"Sunset in Auckland\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/dsc00280.jpg)So there we are \u2013 am now safely here, with all my bags and my hair intact, in a lovely house in Colorado!

Then it drops down and hits one of the few patches of mangrove in New Zealand, we timed it just right and reached the mangrove at low tide, so we could hear snapping shrimp \u2013 it was incredible, a constant popping noise throughout the forest. Then it heads back up and we passed two trees full of nesting cormorants \u2013 fascinating seabirds that nest on land (they\u2019re actually the symbol of the Joint Services Command and Staff College as they encapsulate the natural environment of all 3 armed services).\n\nThen on the way back, as we left the mangrove and crossed a footbridge, there were hundreds of baby fish in the water (not sure what species though) \u2013 as we stood watching them leap out of the water and float in and out of view, a jellyfish came blobbing along gracefully through the water and right under our feet \u2013 it was amazing!\n\nSo that was that \u2013 so this morning, I\u2019ve knitted myself a little case for my MP3 player and baked some bread."},{"header":{"title":"The Mousetrap","slug":"the-mousetrap","date":"20-11-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"20-11-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["NZ Road Trippin'"],"tag":["new zealand","travel","new zealand","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"**21st November 2006, 11.32am**  \n*The Mousetrap Hostel, Paihia*\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since the last update, but we had a lovely few days in Raglan, staying with Nicky (and an enormously fat but lovable cat).

Nicky was housesitting at a lovely place overlooking Whale Bay \u2013 apparently a top surfing spot.\n\nRecharged, we headed south to Waitomo to visit the famous glowworm caves.

Saw 2 sperm whales, dolphins and stuff, but that\u2019s not the point of this entry.\n\nWe returned to the delights of bed making and bog cleaning, using little more than old rags and what can only be described as milky water (or multipurpose cleaner as they seemed to call it\u2026).\n\nAnyway, it rained for 5 days. When I say it rained, imagine someone pouring bucket after bucket of water over you. And then switching on the hosepipe and a wind machine.\n\nWe made the most of it though and joked with our cleaning compadres about how we kept on bringing the bad weather with us and when we left it would clear up, ho ho bloody ho.\n\nSo, I hope you can understand our somewhat mixed emotions at the sight of blue sky and oh, were those mountains always there?\n\nPS We went to Hanmer Springs and Christchurch too."},{"header":{"title":"Franz Josef","slug":"franz-josef","date":"18-10-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"18-10-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["NZ Road Trippin'"],"tag":["new zealand","travel","new zealand","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"**18th October 2006**  \n*Big Red Internet Bus, Franz Josef*\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1164683650_img_1799.jpg \"Jen Ice Climbing\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/1164683650_img_1799.jpg)In a random London bus with internet access in Franz Josef on the west coast, having spent 5 very wet nights here!\n\nOur plan was to arrive, helihike the glacier and buzz on through, but I guess arriving on Friday 13th was never going to be a good sign!

It proved to be a blessing in disguise though, cos we decided to stay and sort ourselves out a bit.

Quite possibly, the most beautiful road I\u2019ve ever been down. It takes about 2 hours to drive, but with all the stops along the way, it took us nearly 3.\n\nFirst stop was Te Anau downs, the launch point for the Milford Track. Next up were Mirror Lakes, perfectly still oxbow lakes that looked like something from Lord of the Rings.\n\nWe stopped for lunch just before the Homer Tunnel looking out over two valleys and miles from anywhere. Two keas (mountain parrots \u2013 reknowned for their cheekiness) joined us and hopped around curious at our presence \u2013 trying to get at our lunch!\n\nThe Homer Tunnel was quite an experience, it\u2019s preceded by the most amazing avalanche carved landscape, really steep mountains with avalanche debris scattered around. The tunnel itself is 1.2km of steep downhill, narrow, unlit road under the mountains. A near brush with a rather large coach led us to safety on the other side and a sight to which adjectives simply don\u2019t do justice \u2013 we were in a massive valley with hundreds of tiny waterfalls gushing down to the floor like veins. The snow that had prevented our kayak trip provided us with a pretty unique spectacle.

We decided not to go for the package coach and cruise, because it felt too processed and like a sausage factory \u2013 the thought of cramming onto a coach full of camera wielding tourists, piling off every half and hour, before piling back on, was just a bit too much. We\u2019d opted for the sea kayak trip to do it differently and to get a real experience. Unfortunately, that meant we didn\u2019t get out into the heart of Milford Sound, which I\u2019m sure is very rewarding, but we\u2019ll keep that for another day.\n\nThe drive back involved a stop at the imaginatively titled Chasm, a huge chasm (unsurprisingly) carved out by water and rocks. It was probably more spectacular than the Sound and one of the most amazing natural features I\u2019ve ever soon \u2013 the sheer volume of water passing through, the noise  \n and the scale of it\u2026 words and photos can\u2019t describe it!"},{"header":{"title":"Te Anau","slug":"te-anau","date":"11-10-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"11-10-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["NZ Road Trippin'"],"tag":["new zealand","travel","new zealand","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"**Sunday 8th-10th**  \n*Te Anau and almost Doubtful Sound*\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/teanaupiershot.jpg \"Pier at Te Anau\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/teanaupiershot.jpg)Unfortunately, our night was a bit spoiled by noisy neighbours blasting out bassy tunes until 4am!

Nice little spot with good facilities and close to the centre.\n\nThe weather continued to worsen into the next day, with heavy rain and winds. Undeterred, we booked up 2 day sea kayak trip round Doubtful Sound with [Fiordland Wilderness Experiences](http:\/\/www.fiordlandseakayak.co.nz\/ \"Link to FWE website\"), run by Daphne and Bill, a lovely couple who really seem to have found their calling.\n\nQuite excited and a little daunted by the thought, we bought some supplies ready for the adventure.

The overwhelming sensation is that of complete mental, emotional and physical exhaustion.\n\nMy main feedback was on my riding. Basically, I need to soften up a bit and develop more progressive vertical movement, particularly in my edged turns. I really don\u2019t think I deserved to pass \u2013 and I actually said that to Greg in our feedback session. He thinks that I\u2019m smart enough to know what I need to do and that I just need more mileage.

Greg didn\u2019t ask too many questions, so I\u2019m fairly relaxed about that. The teaching part of the exam went well, I had to teach switch riding (going backwards) for my session. It went OK, didn\u2019t fully correct a problem, but I went back and got them to work on it again, so clawed my way back to the right path. Basically, I taught them how to traverse, then to do little back-up turns and finally a complete C-turn. Again, not too much of a grilling after that. The only bit I\u2019m really worried about is my riding \u2013 I know I didn\u2019t ride well this week and I don\u2019t feel I was at Stage 1 standard, but we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nWas such a huge relief to finish the exam and I really wanted to go for a celebratory blast around the mountain, mainly to get away from everyone and the exam autopsy that was going on \u2013 grr, hate that!

Definitely a different feel to the CSI exam, much more focussed and I feel that I\u2019m being watched on every run. Had our movement analysis session tonight, which went well but was slightly frustrating as we have to learn to present in a slightly different way from what we\u2019ve been used to.\n\nThat\u2019s part of a bigger challenge \u2013 we\u2019ve got Greg as our examiner and as always we need to work with his particular style, so have to adapt our explanations and approaches so that they match what he\u2019s looking for. I guess it\u2019s good to be flexible, but it\u2019s difficult to change your style!

Fed and watered we raced out to the Saddle Basin.\n\nRiding the quad up to impossibly blue skies, we looked up to see the summit slopes, untracked and covered in fresh snow. The temptation was too much and we hiked on up.  \n We carried on right to the end of the ridgeline and looked out over untouched snow.\n\n[![](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/chewy.jpg \"Chewy about to hit a huge kicker\")](http:\/\/user47216.vs.easily.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/chewy.jpg) Chewy led with a huge drop-off and we were off, racing down, straight into the Powder Bowl Chutes, then hiking up Sundance Ridge before dropping into Hidden Valley (bit sketchy without transceivers). Fresh powder all the way, a few hits and drops \u2013 summit to road, dropping nearly 900 metres, fresh all the way \u2013 awesome.\n\nIt was exactly what we needed today and the moment that stands out in my mind was as we peered over the edge of the summit looking at untracked powder, Neil delivered a rousing speech. I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said, but for a moment, NZSIA, BASI, Stage 1, front knee steering, board performance and all that vanished. Whatever happens over the next week, pass or fail, what matters are moments like that, standing under glorious sunshine with a happy crew and nothing ahead except unblemished snow \u2013 that\u2019s why we all do this.\n\nTo borrow from Shakespeare (Henry V):\n\n*We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;  \n For he to-day that rides his board with me  \n Shall be my brother; be he ne\u2019er so vile,  \n This day shall gentle his condition;  \n And gentlemen in England now-a-bed  \n Shall think themselves accurs\u2019d they were not here,  \n And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks  \n That rode with us upon this fine day.  \n*"},{"header":{"title":"Exam time again","slug":"exam-time-again","date":"19-08-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"19-08-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Rookie Academy"],"tag":["instructing","snow","instructing","snow"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"**19th August 2006, 11.24**  \n*On the sofa, desperately trying to rehydrate myself*\n\nWas supposed to go out last night, but was totally exhausted so went to bed instead.

Neil\u2019s been a great coach and helped me to stop thinking so much and just get into a flow and rhythm. I spent the whole of yesterday focusing on my breathing and timing \u2013 made a huge difference and has really helped me to relax into my riding more rather than get swamped by \u201cam I twisting the board enough? am I flexed? have I broken at the waist? where am I looking? have I pulled the board through properly?\u201d. Still got some things to work on, but getting there.\n\nAlso managed to exorcise my freestyle demons by riding through the park, getting some air off the rollers and nailing a box without trashing my knees! It was the smallest, lowest and easiest box (for those that don\u2019t know what one it, check out [the photos on the TC website](http:\/\/www.treblecone.co.nz\/Info\/terrain-park.asp \"Link to terrain park section of the treble cone website\")), but totally stoked, cos I didn\u2019t have a repeat performance of my last attempt (see [\u2018Big Crunch\u2019](http:\/\/www.dkcy.com\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=50&Itemid=39 \"Link to Big Crunch blog entry\")).\n\nForgot to update on the board situation too \u2013 after trying a couple (and really loving the K2 Darkstar), I fell back in love with my Custom \u2013 now that we\u2019ve learnt to really move the board and flex it, I\u2019ve accepted that it\u2019s me, not the board! Plus by bending it more, it\u2019s starting to mellow out a bit and get easier.\n\nAs for the Stage 1 exam, it\u2019s another 5 day jobby, starting on Wednesday:\n\n- Wed AM \u2013 Rider improvement and review of 4 movements\n- Wed PM \u2013 review levels 1 and 2, review Movement Analysis\n- - - - - -\n\n- Thu AM \u2013 Rider improvement \u2013 skidded turns (lots of switch riding here)\n- Thu PM \u2013 Level 3 progression, movement analysis practice\n- Thu NIGHT \u2013 Movement Anaylsis exam practice\n- - - - - -\n\n- Fri AM \u2013 Rider improvement \u2013 edged turns\n- Fri PM \u2013 Level 4 progression \u2013 strong edge.

We\u2019re continually assessed on our riding, which is a bit of a stress, but just need to focus really. Jim and Dan will be our examiners, which is a mixed blessing, but at least it\u2019ll be nice ot have familiar faces.\n\nAnother storm cycle is passing through, which is great for snow, but yesterday was pretty crappy. Lots of rain and wind, so we were wet through by 3 o\u2019clock and called it a day early.

Some of the boys got busy building a kicker (a jump for those not up to speed in snowboard parlance) so I took advantage and got ready with my camera.

It feels like it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s time to move on, to experience something new and to explore what I want to do and where I want to be.\n\nBut it still feels quite risky to do that \u00e2&#128;&#147; I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m leaving career momentum, opportunity and certainty behind. It\u00e2&#128;&#153;s only for a few months, but I guess I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m scared I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll regret it, that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll have handicapped my potential or my future by this.\n\nAs a result or possibly contributing separately, I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m beginning to feel unsure about this and whether it really is something that I really want to do. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m not in the right physical shape at the moment and I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m not particularly driven to get myself back into shape. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m not sure if I can afford it or whether there\u00e2&#128;&#153;s something else I would rather spend that money on. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m worried about what it will mean for my relationship. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m worried that it won\u00e2&#128;&#153;t be this amazing life-changing experience \u00e2&#128;&#147; that\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll it\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll just be a few months dossing about and then I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll come back, maybe a bit fitter, a bit better at snowboarding, but essentially no different. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m scared that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll go on this journey and find it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s a dead end, so then I have to retrace my steps and pick up my life from where I left it. Maybe I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m just trying to prove a point and rebelling for the sake of it.\n\nBasically, I feel like I don\u00e2&#128;&#153;t know what the hell I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m doing anymore and I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m beginning to doubt my instincts.\n\nBut then again, isn\u2019t that why I\u2019m doing this?"},{"header":{"title":"Initial Plans!","slug":"initial-plans","date":"09-02-2006","published":true,"publish_date":"09-02-2006","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["Rookie Academy"],"tag":["travel","travel"]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"Right!

I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve decided to start a blog. Why am I starting a blog when I should be working and trying to crack the impenetrable issues around the inclusion of aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme? Well, I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve been feeling a certain malaise that I believe afflicts all twenty-somethings of my generation. A feeling that despite the affluence, stability and material possessions, something is not quite right.\n\nI work in a job that people would die for, tackling one of the biggest challenges to mankind. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m paid well and live in a nice flat in the heart of Balham. I have a beautiful girlfriend who understands me and doesn\u00e2&#128;&#153;t nag. I have a wonderful family who support and inspire me. I drive a nice car, have at least one week\u00e2&#128;&#153;s holiday a year, usually in an exotic destination. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m fit and healthy, despite my regular socialising. But something\u00e2&#128;&#153;s not quite right in my soul.\n\nI\u00e2&#128;&#153;m bored of the routine and the feeling that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m somehow trapped in a giant maze, running around scrabbling towards some ill-defined goal. Maybe it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s just what happens when you hit the stage of life between formal education, with all its goals and pathways, and parenthood with its responsibility and selflessness, but I feel that life should be about more than the day-to-day grind, the relentless pursuit of a career (I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve never understood why we call it that, is it because we spend most of it careering around?).\n\nSo, anyway, I guess this is all a long-winded way (years of civil service training is hard to overcome) of saying that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve decided to take control of my life and do something different.\n\nEver since I first strapped on a piece of wood to my feet and slid in a most ungainly manner down the slightest of\u00e2&#128;\u00a6 actually that\u00e2&#128;&#153;s a lie. I didn\u00e2&#128;&#153;t really enjoy snowboarding when I first tried it. Sure it was good fun, something a bit different, but I lived in fear of another face-plant or coxyx shattering impact. It wasn\u00e2&#128;&#153;t really until my second week of boarding, when it suddenly came together and I felt in flow that I caught the bug. The combination of mountains, snow and a basic form of transport powered only be natural forces was quite hypnotic. I love the almost meditative qualities of a focussed run, the feel of crisp snow beneath your feet, the rush of air past your freezing ears and the rosy glow that the biting wind leaves on your cheeks. So for one week a year (sometimes more), I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve found my way out and a way to escape the drudgery of city life.\n\nBut one week has never seemed enough, just as I begin to feel in tune with it, it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s whipped away and replaced with an early morning, hungover crawl to the airport, sweating alcohol in a tin can that lands in the inevitably grey London skies. So I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve decided to do a season, not just any old season mind you. I need a bit of structure and a way to improve, so I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ve opted to train as a snowboard instructor, an ideal way to combine my love of snowboarding with my love of sharing skills with other people. Oh, and it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s in New Zealand (Wanaka to be precise), for 3 months.\n\nWhat am I hoping to get out of it? Space. Time. Freedom to think about what actually matters to me, about how I\u00e2&#128;&#153;d like to be remembered and about what the hell to do with myself and the precious gift of life. Challenge, a change, a sense of liberation and a feeling that I can take control of my life, that it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s not just about stepping over others in a desperate bid for recognition and promotion.\n\nIt\u00e2&#128;&#153;s not been an easy decision and it won\u00e2&#128;&#153;t be an easy 3 months. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m moving to the total opposite side of the world from the love of my life, away from my friends, family and social circle. I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m leaving a great job. And I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m terrified, that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m not good enough, that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;m not enough of an extreme thrill seeker, that I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll hurt myself, that I won\u00e2&#128;&#153;t enjoy it. But it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s something I feel like I need to do. If it goes wrong, I\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll handle it somehow \u2013 that\u00e2&#128;&#153;s partly why I want to do it, it feels like a risk, a leap of faith (OK, it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s only 3 months in another country, but it\u00e2&#128;&#153;s a psychological thing). I keep thinking about looking back on this and how I want to view this point in my life. And one thing keeps running through my head, the last stanza in my favourite poem:\n\n> \u00e2&#128;&#156;I shall be telling this with a sigh  \n>  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  \n>  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \u00e2&#128;&#147;  \n>  I took the one less travelled by.  \n>  And that has made all the difference.\u00e2&#128;&#157;\n\nThanks Bob, that\u00e2&#128;&#153;ll keep me going."},{"header":{"title":"Intro","slug":"intro","date":"08-12-2004","published":true,"publish_date":"08-12-2004","visible":true,"summary":{"enabled":true,"format":"short","size":128},"taxonomy":{"migration-status":"review","category":["The Rat Race"],"tag":[]},"author":"admin","metadata":{"author":"admin"}},"content":"This will eventually be a weblog, once I\u2019ve decided if I\u2019m going to keep a blog and what I\u2019ll focus on with it!
